It started off as just a regular Saturday: playful, passionate morning sex followed by a movie and an early lunch. My boyfriend and I have been dating for several months now but we still have that new relationship excitement.
I've never told him about my desperation fetish but I think he'd find it gross. He's as macho as he's totally hot, and I don't want to take the risk. The closest I get to involving him is being slightly full during sex sometimes, simply to increase my own pleasure.
Being into desperation gives me the advantage of not genuinely being caught short too often. But today I overlooked the effect of "breaking the seal". I previously thought that this only happened with beer but learned the hard way that this is not the case. Basically if you drink large quantities of fluid over a few hours, you can put off peeing the first time for a while but After that you'll go from needing to pee to practically wetting yourself relatively quickly.
The timeline:
9am – 10oz water 10am – 16oz iced tea
By the time 11:30am came around I figured I should use the bathroom before the movie. I wasn't at all desperate but I was feeling enough pressure that I knew it would become a real problem during the movie. So I went.
Once the movie was over, we had lunch at a really nice Japanese place. I drank three or four 8oz glasses all together without having realized it at the time. The server kept refilling my glass. Just as we were leaving, I was getting some very early warning signs from my bladder but I ignored them because my boyfriend was running late. I would have gone if I had considered it a real problem. That was an underestimation on my part to say the least. 
I went from slightly uncomfortable to so full I wouldn't be able to walk straight very quickly. Thankfully we were in the car, which made it easy to clamp my legs together and press my pussy against the seat. On the other hand, we were on a busy highway with no place to pull over without hundreds of people watching. I was the one driving which made it slightly more difficult. I found it impossible to maintain a real conversation and control my bladder at the same time but I don't think I was fidgeting. I was good at maintaining the fa�ade.
At first it was kind of an exciting challenge. I was even getting horny at the thought of fighting this secret battle right in front of my boyfriend. But as time goes on, even more liquid was being forced into my already full bladder and I started wondering if I could physically hold it. I managed to hold it though with only one or two small spurts. I even kissed him as he left the car. I managed not to gasp as the seat belt pressed against my abdomen when I leaned over.
I jammed one hand into my crotch as I sped away. I was wearing a mid–length skirt and panties, which were getting progressively damp. As I headed back towards the highway to get home, I started to get frantic. I knew how to drop my boyfriend off but I did not know the area. And I was getting very close to completely losing control. I turned onto the nearest side street, pulled over and found a large coffee cup from the day before. It was on the floor of the passenger side and I nearly peed myself trying to get at it.
Frantically trying to hold my pee in just a bit longer, I pulled my panties down, put the cup between my legs and sat with my knees on the seat. It was in the middle of the day, and I was terrified of being seen. I was more terrified of making my car smell of pee and actually peeing myself like a little girl though.
My pee poured out of me like a faucet into the cup. It splashed a little wetting my skirt a little but it was minor damage considering what would have happened if I had not enacted this desperate measure. It was the first time I had done anything like this, and I had the craziest sensation that I was peeing myself even though I knew that a container was catching it. I had to stop when I felt the cup getting full which was torture. I poured the contents of the cup onto the street and put the cup back under my skirt to continue. I did this a total of three times before I was totally empty.
I drove home feeling physically relieved and bewildered at what I had just done. Then I realized it was totally hot in retrospect.
