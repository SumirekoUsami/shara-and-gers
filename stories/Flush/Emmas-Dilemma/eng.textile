"Won," Eve triumphed smiling, for the third time in a row. Emma looked surprised at empty checkerboard on the table between them and muttered: "Just luck, nothing more! I bet you cannot win another time?" Eve looked out the train window. "Hey Emma, at what time will our train arrive?" "Do not worry," Emma said, "it is still more than a half hour drive down to Marseilles, and we have plenty of time left." "Ok well I agree, just one game, but that's also the last!" Eve replied. "And then I quickly go to the bathroom," she added in her mind, because they had a lot of drinks on board of the train, and she felt her bladder pushing against the elastic of her skirt, gently but slowly becoming more firm.
Eve and Emma were two psychology students, just graduated, and they had decided the two of them would make a great trip across Europe by train. They had the entire route already mapped out for days, bought train tickets, hostels booked, everything to the last detail. In about 40 minutes they would arrive in Marseilles, where they would spend their first night. Their train was divided in separate compartments, and the girls had one compartment occupied. The atmosphere was excellent, and Emma brought a wide range of drinks with her, light alcoholic but not too heavy, so they could drink a lot without really getting drunk. The entire window side of the table was already filled with empty liquor bottles. 
"D�j� vu?" Eve mocked, 5 minutes later, when she outwitted her for the fourth time with her last piece. "Not funny," Emma muttered, but she could not suppress a sheepish smile. "Ok, ok, I admit it, you're just better in this game," she added, "a toast to the victor, and our big European trip!"
Emma put her lips to the next bottle and gulped the liquor, and Eve followed her example. "And now I gotta use the bathroom," Eve said to Emma then. "Yeah, I could really use that too!" Emma said clearly. "Otherwise, you go first," Eve politely said. "Well, if you need it so badly..." Emma said, as politely as Eve did. "No, no, not at all, you go first, I'll stay here to watch out for our stuff," Eve lied a bit. Eve did not have to say that twice, because Emma had to use the bathroom as much as she did! Emma closed the door behind her, and went in the direction of the nearest toilet, which could be found in the next coach. Now she was the only one walking on the aisle, and she couldn't help to notice how full her bladder really was. Unconsciously she accelerated her pace a little, towards the toilet. But when she arrived, the toilet was obviously occupied. "Now that's just typical," she thought, not that these few seconds would matter, but still. She leaned against the wall, and stared through the nearby glass door, into the bar. Wow, did she see that for real? She moved closer to the door to take a better look. Oh yes, what a hottie behind the bar! Her heart melted. She glanced at the closed bathroom door, then back to the bar. The bartender was apparently alone, not really surprising, because it was already quite late now.
There was a little twinkle in her eyes, as she glanced at the closed bathroom door for the last time. "Oh what," she grinned, "it's time to score..." and she went to the bar. "Sorry, we're closed," said the bartender with an obvious Dutch accent. Emma's heart pounded in her throat. And then he was Belgian too! That wasn't just luck, this was faith! "Hey, you can also say it in the Dutch you know, Emma opened the conversation, laughing. The boy looked surprised. "How did you...?" "Come on," Emma laughed, "your English accent is even worse than the German of Jean–Marie Pfaff!" The bartender was still looking very surprised at the girl that just entered his bar. "Emma, it's nice to meet you," Emma said for herself. "David," he replied. "And if you really want to know, I'm from Bruges, although it remains a mystery to me, how you could guess that, with only hearing an English sentence by me." Emma grinned, and she broke the ice once again. "Ah, I know a bit of human nature, and a bit of helpless English ... So, what can I drink from you, Mr. Bruges?" 
"My name is David and I was just about to close the bar, actually." David pointed to the opening hours on the door of the bar compartment. Emma looked very uninterested and replied: "Come on, the bar is open until 1 and it is just..." "... Quarter past 1," David added, while he put some glasses in the cupboard. But Emma was not going to give up so fast. "Please, a drink, that's all I ask for, I promise" Emma begged. "As a matter of fact, I'll buy you one!" "In that case... just one then!" David laughed, "But I must warn you, those drinks are pretty expensive here." Emma ignored that last remark. "A whiskey–cola, please! Or no, make it two, suit yourself." Emma jumped on one of the bar stools, and she saw through the glass door, how the toilet door was open, and the lady who had occupied it walked away. She also wondered how Eve would be doing, but she thought to herself, "Probably she would do it herself if she would have the chance. She will understand." 
She crossed her legs and looked into David's eyes. "A lot of whiskey, a little bit of cola," Emma said while David poured both glasses. A bit of alcohol would loose their tongues; Emma knew from personal experience... "And what brings you here, all alone?" She tried to start the conversation over again. "He's not really a talkative guy, but damn hot" Emma thought... "Well, I'm here with two friends, we are on our way to Geneva. My father, who works at the SNCB, has given me this holiday job so I am able to pay a part of my journey. So basically, I get a free ride to Geneva, and now earn some money, just for fun. And what's your story, also alone?"
"No, my friend is in the train carriage next door, we are making a tour of Europe, and now we are heading to Marseilles." 
"So your is girlfriend sitting there, all alone now?" David looked doubtful. Emma's smooth talking stopped for a second. She obviously didn't want it to be clear that she was just hitting on him. But as soon as she stopped talking, she had an answer ready. "Well, the thing is, we were so stupid, and we didn't bring enough drinks for the trip, for the last five hours I've had nothing to drink, so I went to grab a drink while my girlfriend Eve is still with stuff..." David nodded and put the two glasses of whiskey–cola on the bar. "Cheers to the holidays!" Emma cheered, and she casually let her hand slide over to David's hand. 
It was very quiet in the compartment where Eve was, now that Emma was away. Eve didn't feel at ease, all alone. "For how long has Emma been gone already? Not that long. A minute– or five?" Eve searched trough her backpack to find her phone. "22 past 1." She bent down a little and put the phone back in her pocket. She nervously clenched her right leg together and she felt a bit of pain in her abdomen, caused by the bending. She pulled her sweater up a little, just to see how her belly was. She laid her right hand softly on her belly and rubbed her skin. She was staring at her belly button and rubbed in small circles around it. A few moments later the silence was broken by an announcement.
"Madames et messieurs, nous arriverons � Marseille dans approximent trente minutes. Ladies and gentlemen, we will arrive in Marseilles in about thirty minutes. Medammen und herren, wir sollen arriveren im Marseille im dreiBiz minuten." 
Eve moaned softly and put both her hands on her belly. Her two hands slowly moved up and down with each breath, along with the movement of her belly. Still gazing at her belly, she was surprised that her belly could be so firm and round. She had never seen her lower body like that– she simply had to use the bathroom so much!
Emma also had heard the announcement in the bar, though she was less pleased to hear the message. Just one half hour left to impress David, and the conversation was not going really smoothly yet. In addition to that, she got extra nervous from the signals she was constantly getting from her full bladder. But Emma was not going to give up so fast. "What this conversation needs, is more alcohol," she thought. Challengingly, she drank her glass in one gulp, and then put it down on the bar. "Well Mr. Bartender from Bruges, can't you keep up with my pace?" She pointed to David's glass, which was still half full. "Afraid of a little drink, or a girlfriend who is waiting for you?" Emma squeezed her eyes a little closer, and winked to David. Emma began to chuckle. "Just kidding, drink at your own pace, but... pour me a second one." Clearly intimidated by shameless words of Emma, David gave her another drink, and answered: "No girlfriend who is waiting for me, sorry. And your boyfriend, what does he think of your alcoholic escapades?" Emma couldn't suppress a small smile. "Subtle, very subtle, mister," she said to herself. Emma replied, just as mysterious as untruthful. "What he doesn't know– doesn't hurt, right?" "And that fact that I have no boyfriend for the moment, makes it much easier," she laughed. An even bigger smile came on her face. The first act of flirting... She quickly pushed her hand in her crotch, very softly, and continued the conversation.
Eve, in the meanwhile, was still in the same position, with both hands on her bare belly, when someone who knocked at the door suddenly startled her. Quickly she pulled her shirt down, and the door slid open. "Can I see your tickets, please?" she heard a man in a very neatly ironed uniform speak. Shocked by her unexpected visitor, she felt the elastic of her skirt firmly pushing on her bladder again, and she pushed her buttocks together. "Yes, off course," Eve said, very shy. She grabbed in Emma's bag, which was in the seat across her, and searched for the tickets. She was a little nervous in the presence of this unknown man, who was staring at her– especially now, as her need for a bathroom was really, really intense. She pushed her thighs and knees together, and gently wiggled from her one foot to the other one. She turned her head sideways, and saw the man, still staring at her body. Eve's face went red. She did not know where Emma kept the tickets in her bag– that was Emma's responsibility. "Come on, where are those tickets..." 
Eve couldn't help it at all but her and her full bladder were getting more nervous by the second. When she was just sitting, a few minutes ago, she actually forgot how urgently she needed a bathroom. But now, while she was searching for the tickets in stress, her need came back to her attention, twice as hard. To her joy, she saw the plastic bag with the two pieces of paper. "Gotcha!" Eve exclaimed, maybe a little too loud, and her face went red even more. She sheepishly handed the tickets to the conductor. With a slightly beaten voice over she added: "My other girlfriend went to the bathroom." "Ok, thank you, enjoy your trip!" The man closed the door behind him. 
Eve threw the tickets on the table and jumped right back into her seat, but clearly less at ease than before. "What the hell is Emma doing?" she wondered, as she rubbed her aching belly. She looked at her phone. Emma was almost away for like a quarter of an hour, she guessed. "Come on Emma, I gotta pee so bad...," she hissed between her teeth, realizing that that wouldn't help at all. She could not leave all their precious stuff in a distant, unknown place like this.
With the tips of her fingers she rubbed her bikini line, and the part squeezed between her legs already felt very damp. Luckily it was just sweat. It was also very hot in there. Warmer by the minute, it seemed. All the effort she had to make, to keep her pee inside her, made her sweat like a pig. She looked at the little piece of visible skin between her skirt and her top. If her adult willpower didn't stop her, she would have just done it here, in her pants. And where the heck was Emma? In about fifteen minutes they would arrive in Marseilles! There was no way that Eve could hold on for so long. She tried to think clearly. Couldn't she urinate somewhere here, in this compartment? She looked around, but couldn't see an obvious solution. So there was no other alternative than to sit here, and try to hold her pee for another little while... 
But how long was "another little while?" Some shadows occasionally appeared in the hallway, people must have been walking back and forth, but she couldn't see Emma anywhere. "Try to think of something else, Eve," she said to herself, to give herself a little more courage. But not matter how hard she tried, her bladder was screaming for attention so much; Eve's poor brains couldn't think of nothing else. Still sitting down, she softly pushed the door of their compartment, and threw a quick glance at the hallway. "Emma?" she tried softly. But there was nothing to see in the dark. "Emma?" she tried again, a little more desperate. Eve moaned softly, and closed the door again. Just to be sure, she slipped her hand in her underpants, which were getting very sweaty. Her arm was placed on her abdomen. Eve's breath's was getting heavier by the minute. As the elastic of her skirt wasn't pushing on her belly anymore, she felt more comfortable, and she kept her hand under the elastic and into her panties.
Unfortunately, this effect already faded out after just a few moments, and Eve had to go pee as much as she did before. She began to breathe faster once again, and desperately searched for a way out. Maybe she had a jar that she could pee in? But beyond the empty bottles on the table, she couldn't see anything. She moaned once again, her fingers firmly pushed against her labia. Or maybe she could put a towel under her and pee on it? But that would make such a mess. Desperate, she looked around further. Or maybe she could try to pee out of the window? But she realized that the small window made urinating impossible, and she also rejected that plan. All her hope lay with Emma...
But Emma was still sitting in the bar, drinking her whiskey–cola calmly. Although, calmly? Her bladder was more than full in the meanwhile. It was already full when she was in the compartment with Eve actually, and that extra half hour plus two full glasses of whiskey–cola had not improved her condition.
But Emma wasn't prepared to just let her catch go; her flirting needs were bigger than her physical needs. Still staring into David's eyes, and sipping her last drop of whiskey–cola, she sat behind the counter, bouncing up and down on her barstool, without David noticing of course. Her left hand had disappeared already minutes ago, under the counter. And occasionally– more frequently as time progressed; she pushed it firmly between her legs. David poured his third whiskey–cola, and Emma had to suppress a grin. "Every time, it works every time," she thought triumphantly. If there was one thing that a man couldn't stand, it was a woman who drank more alcohol than he did. 
Emma's master plan was again a success, because the alcohol had loosened their tongues a lot. Shy David was talking about the sunny destination where he would go with his friends, and what they would do on their journey. Emma was a little quieter for the last several minutes, because the signals her bladder was sending were getting painful. She tried to focus on David's story, but the one thing that she was really focused on, and was constantly in her thoughts, was the little voice that told her that she needed a bathroom RIGHT NOW. 
She quickly drank the last drop from her glass and put it on the counter. She wanted to tell David that she had to go to the toilet, but she was too ashamed to do that. Especially considering he was a boy she'd only just met. So all she could do was make a single cough. She just could not tell David that she had to go to the bathroom! She felt like a little girl.
While she remained silent, she tried to listen to David's story again, and she pushed her clammy hand in the crotch of her pants. "Come on... you must tell him, Emma," she was thinking. She began to sweat more and more. Oh, oh, she had to pee so bad... But no, she couldn't say anything, not in the presence of such a hottie. What if he got the impression, that she was a still little girl who couldn't hold her pee? But Emma finally collapsed under the pressure. 
While David was still talking, she suddenly blurted out: "... I have to go to the toilet." Emma stammered. Shocked by her own weak tone, she recovered and said; "Before we start a final round." She was about to jump off her bar stool, and she was ready to run like the wind towards the toilets, when David replied: "Well, if you go to the toilet, I'm going to sleep, it is incredibly late, and I need to get up tomorrow morning to serve coffee. " He dimmed the lights above the bar, to make it look real. For the very first time this evening, Emma felt very uncertain. He was just giving her a goodbye like that, without giving her a kiss or his telephone number? 
But at the other hand she had to pee so terribly. "I'll come back, promise," Emma tried, but David answered, "Come on, can't you hold on a little longer? We will arrive in Marseilles soon, and..." David leaned forward. "And?" Emma asked, intrigued. "... And I still haven't got your phone number," David said. "Or don't you want to give it to me?" David had no idea how close Emma was to soaking her panties, and he thought that Emma's remark was an excuse for her to leave.
Now Emma's dilemma was really complete. He wanted her! Obviously. How could she leave now? She couldn't! That would sound like a rejection, and that was the last thing Emma wanted. "One last round," she said after a little hesitation, as she tried to smile. Inside of her, she felt her bladder protesting violently. She watched how David poured her glass once again, and laid her right hand on David's hand. Her other hand was pressed between her two legs...
"Shit, shit, shit, Emma!" Eve shouted now desperately in the compartment. Only ten minutes until they arrived, and Emma was already gone for like a half hour! Eve had to abandon hope that Emma would come back. In the meanwhile, she had to pee so badly that her bladder could explode any second now, despite all the effort she had put into holding her pee. "Shit, shit!" She cried out once again with tears in her eyes. She now had her panties pulled down to her knees, so she could press her hand directly on her lips. With her bare buttocks she was sweating on the soft fabric of the chair. She cried out once again, a little quieter this time. Trembling with adrenaline, she pushed her hand firmly against her bare crotch over and over again, moving faster and faster. She almost couldn't control her bladder anymore, all she could now do was pee, pee like a racehorse. Something that she wanted to avoid, no matter what, but she just didn't know how. 
Emma would definitely pee her chair and her panties, if she had to stay here. There was only one thing to do. For a second or two she tried to calm down, straining every muscle in her body, and with a loud groan she jumped out of her chair. She used her last little bit of strength, trying to keep to keep the puddle inside her, as she ran straight to the toilet, as fast as she could. She sprinted out of her compartment, with her panties still down around her thighs, and her hand still holding her crotch. With her private parts completely visible, she ran towards the toilet. 
Fortunately for her, there was nobody in the hallway at this particular moment. Slowly but surely, she felt her control slipping away. With every step she took, she came closer to the blue illuminated toilet sign in the hallway. She was almost there. It seemed like an eternity. She felt her fingers getting wet, and a trickle running down her legs. 
The first big drops hit her palm when she was at the toilet door. In a haze, she pulled her hand away from her crotch, and immediately she saw how a small trickle became a huge yellow waterfall. One second after she pulled her hand away, the stream was splashing on the floor. While peeing she saw the glowing toilet bowl, and she quickly bent over to sit on the thing. She smacked against the bowl with her buttocks. She sat on the bowl with her face to the sink, and she tried to spread her legs as much as she could, because she still had her pink panties hanging down around her knees. She relaxed and even more pee came out of her aching body. Only a part of it actually landed in the bowl, and she felt the biggest part of her pee splashing on her feet, or running along her spread legs. Soon she was standing in a puddle, sobbing, humiliated, but also a little relieved. Her pee went merrily into all directions, and slowly the heavy stream began to fade out. Eve could now aim her pee in the toilet bowl with her fingers, which were already wet with pee anyway. 
Without stopping, still with a strong clean stream, Eve emptied her bladder, and after her bladder was entirely empty, she stopped her pee exactly the same way, without shocks or aftershocks. She looked around her, and surveyed the damage. Her feet were all wet and her panties couldn't be more soaked, but her skirt was still amazingly dry. She took a lot of toilet paper and closed the door, which was still open. With the toilet paper she dried her body first, and then she tried to clean the floor, so no one would see her accident. She pulled her wet panties back up, and the soaked textile piece was almost glued to her crotch and abdomen. Slowly she opened the door, and saw how the carpet in the corridor was also a little wet. She was so ashamed but she could not dry the splashes on the carpet anyway, so she went back to her compartment. Only 5 minutes left until they arrived, so she'd better start cleaning up. Without bothering to dress properly, she put all bottles and other things silently in their bags. 
In the meanwhile, Emma's glass was still standing on the bar. Emma's body was screaming out in pain, but she could hide that pretty well on the outside. The flirting game with David had now almost reached its peak, and Emma had David's telephone number written on a piece of paper, which was on the bar. Emma and David looked each other in the eye, while Emma was playing a game with her willpower, trying to hold on with her hand. She didn't dare to slide her hand into her pants, what if David saw it? But she hadn't released her hand from the crotch of her pants, for five minutes. 
She heavily wiggled her buttocks on her stool, from front to back; it was really hard to imagine that David did not notice. Her upper body was also moving, somewhat less strikingly, but also moving back and forth pretty constantly. But the vibration in Emma's body language actually just looked cute and sexy. Emma end David didn't realize that the train was slowing down and they were almost in Marseilles. 
There was a small silence. David looked Emma in the eyes, and gave her a naughty look, and before she knew it, David leaned forward over the bar, and pressed his lips against those of Emma. Emma's heartbeat stopped, and David leaned back again. After which Emma, forgetting her pee for a few seconds, leaned forward herself and pressed her lips to his. In a sort of trance Emma's lips played a game with David's lips, but after a few seconds of glory, Emma went back to reality, and felt how her bladder was compressing while she was bent over. 
She wanted to cry, let her pee flow, but somehow, because of the energy boost that flew through her body; she managed to keep her pee inside her bladder. She pushed her hand between her legs with all of her force, and she could not suppress a groan of pain. But fortunately David thought that she was expressing her feelings of ecstasy, a reaction to his kiss. 
Emma leaned back and tried to sit normal again, moaning again yet another time. David got a twinkle in his eyes and thought, "Wow, this girl is very hot!" Emma, on the contrary, had the tears in her eyes, but tried to sit still nonetheless– after that fantastic kiss she could not possibly run away! She recrossed her legs, hoping that it would make holding easier, but on the contrary, the pain in her abdomen was getting worse, while David remained staring into her eyes. 
Quickly she crossed her legs again, and pushed her fingers firmly against her crotch, somewhere in the neighborhood of her pee hole. She pushed, pushed, and shoved her fingers in her crotch even harder, so hard it almost hurt. For a few seconds she regained control, but then the pain came back in waves, and no matter how hard she tried, something in her forced her to pee, and her bladder failed under the immense pressure. She felt a tiny, tiny amount of fluid escaping from her bladder, but she pushed her hand against her pee hole so hard, that nothing could escape. But it felt so immensely painful, Emma could start crying, and she slowly began to lose control of her upper body. 
Trembling, she felt the grip around her crotch gently relax, just enough for the pool in Emma's body, to drain away. She moaned once again and felt a trickle of pee slowly running into her panties. She pushed second her hand between her legs, and felt her panties, and then her shorts getting wet. But thank God, her bladder regained control, so that Emma hadn't soaked her pants entirely; the wet patch on her shorts was not that big yet. She needed a bathroom like never before, and wondered whether she could walk out of the bar without David realizing what she was doing. Although she had never been to this point before in her life, not even close, she wasn't used to having to urinate so badly, but she told herself that she just could not pee in her pants, she was mature, she had to tolerate this. But her stomach was in so much pain, all she wanted was to get the pee outside of her bladder, she wanted the pain to stop. 
But with her last remaining scrap of willpower, she held it in one way or another. Her eyes went from the toilet door, to the paper with David's phone number that lay on the bar, and in one motion she grabbed the paper just as David said: "We have arrived!" She quickly gazed outside, and saw that the train was standing still, and had been for a short while, because passengers were already leaving in the escalators, on the platform. Emma jumped, with her hand tightly holding her pee hole and sprinted, to the outside. When she was outside the bar, she heard a whistle from the conductor, the signal that the train was leaving again. Emma quickly jumped between the closing doors, and landed on the platform, where she saw Eve, with all their bags. "Emma, where have you...?" tried Eve, but Emma shouted triumphantly:" Telephone number! Hottie!" while she was waving with the paper in her hand. But despite her victory, she still had to use the bathroom, unbelievable urgently. 
"Emma!" she exclaimed. "I gotta pee!" With a last attempt, she tried to find a toilet on the platform, and she saw an arrow hanging over the escalators pointing to the sanitary facilities, and tried to run that way. But without immediately realizing it, almost immune from all the pain she had already had to endure, her bladder was happily relaxing, and she felt a large pee stream running straight into her pants. Realizing that there was nothing more she could do, she stopped walking and pulled her pants down in one smooth motion, in the middle of the platform. She already had unbuttoned her pants before, and her pants slid down like butter to her feet. Eve was watching this spectacle with eyes wide open, and an open mouth– only to see how an immense yellow beam landing on the ground between her legs, making a loud splattering sound. Eve saw that Emma closed her eyes and clearly enjoyed the moment, while some passengers, who where still waiting on the platform, stared at the peeing girl.
Emma, however, couldn't care less. She slowly opened her eyes, and started laughing with joy when she saw the yellow stream running out of her body, through her sore labia. The large puddle flew, along with the slope of the platform, down on to the tracks, and Emma started to wiggle her ass back and forth when she was done peeing. Her shoes and the rest of her legs had remained dry, only her panties and shorts had a big soaking spot on them, and compared to the power of Emma's pee, that wasn't even so bad either.
Emma pulled her pants up again, looked at Eve and said, as if nothing had happened: "Come on Eve, are we leaving?" She picked the paper with David's number up from the ground, and hopped over to Eve. Eve said, with a sad looking face: "I've also done it in my pants..." They looked at each other, and all Emma and Eve could do, was laugh. Was this an eventful beginning to an eventful journey?
