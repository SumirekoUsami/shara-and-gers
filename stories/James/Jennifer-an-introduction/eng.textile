The following is a true and honest account of my wife, only her name has been changed. I met my wife some 14 years ago, while at the University. Jennifer was and still is a very hard working lady as well as a loving wife. She is 5ft. 10in.tall, weighs 9stone 12lbs, has dark hair and a tremendous figure. We married in 1990 and Jennifer qualified as a chartered accountant the following year. She now works for a large accountancy firm in Manchester, England. I have been to a number of professional functions with her and she has always turned men’s heads. When she goes to work she always wears a fitted suit and tights. The skirt is usually short enough to show off her legs but not so short as to make her look like a tart. Jennifer – though I hate to say it because I so hate the word – is mildly incontinent, though, as she prefers to say, "she suffers from the occasional involuntary relaxation of the pelvic floor muscles." Over the last 14 years I have seen 19 major accidents (where she has ended up in, stood, or sat in a puddle) and have been aware of four others. On average I would say she had a major flood every 3 or 4 months. The number of times I witnessed her having to change during the day or pee behind a bush or the car is countless. Over the following weeks I will relay some of the accidents. Why you ask? Well, I am so very turned on by them and as of yet I have never told her. I think she would have a fit if she knew.
