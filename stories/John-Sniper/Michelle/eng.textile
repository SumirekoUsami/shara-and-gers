We were halfway through writing our grade 10 maths paper and almost two hours into the test, when Michelle started fidgetting in her chair. Immediately, the idea dawned on me that she needed to pee, but I didn't say anything. Over the next ten minutes, she began to get nervous and I knew that it was only a matter of time before she would be forced to either ask the Teacher or embarrass herself infront of the whole class. On top of that, I knew that the test was going to be 4� hours and that the restroombreak was set for 2� hours into the test, which meant that she was probably going to have to wait anyway. After 2 hours, she was starting to wiggle her legs back and forth frantically, which told me that she was nearing her emergency zone. And true enough, she raised her hand a moment later and then ask the Teacher if she could go.
But the Teacher looked back at her with a sympathy and replied that he was sorry, but that their were six other girls, who are also waiting and they had asked first. Michelle then went a livid red and I knew that her bladder must have been really full, when she begged saying that she really need to go bad and whether he couldn't make an exception that time. He then replied saying that it was too bad, but it would be unfair to the other girls and anycase that she would still have had to wait until quarter past two before she could go in anycase, as those were the test rules. Michelle then began to squirm in her seat and suck her breath in, as I saw that she had started shaking. The Teacher then walked away to go to the next student and Michelle turned to me to ask me to do something, because she was going to burst. There was nothing that I could have done and so I told her that, but she was really getting desperate.
By five past two, she had started to push her hands into her groin and I saw that there was sweat running down her under her arms. After a minute, she had begun to groan and gasp with her hands locked between her crossed legs. At that point her whole body was tensed from her shoulders right down to tightly clasped ankles and knees.
A minute later, I saw her body freeze in mid motion and saw that a small dark stain had appeared in her crotch beneath the palms of her hands. She then went into a flat panic and let out a soft almost continous moan that suddenly became broken as her bladder burst its banks and emptied itself in spurts, completely drenching her pants before running off the front of her chair. It was an incredible mess, with the wet stain running halfway up her butt.
She was very embarrassed and had to ignore the teasing of the other boys until the end of the test period and then we phoned our Mom to come and take her home. The only pity was that I didn't have a camera then, as I would have definately taken a foto. Michelle has had quite a few embarrassing moments like that, not because of a weak bladder or any thing, sometimes she just bursts. She does sometimes have to run to the restroom if she laughs too much.
