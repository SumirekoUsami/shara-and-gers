Getting into the car, Ian suggested that they call for some lunch and a drink at his club. Jill was a little concerned about going in with no panties on, a predicament arising from their exploits in the car park. She felt her skirt was damp at the back, but Ian reassured her that it did not show. Going in to the club, which was very elegant, they checked in, and then proceeded to their respective toilets to freshen up. In the luxurious ladies' toilet Jill wiped her tummy and legs with a damp flannel, before applying perfume between her thighs, wishing she had retrieved some clean panties from her case. Then she repaired her make up and tidied up her hair. With one final look in the large mirror she felt satisfied with the result, and feeling much more confident went to join Ian in the bar. Ian, having gone through a similar cleaning up process was waiting for her; he greeted her affectionately, kissing her on the cheek and then leading her to a low corner table, settled her at his side on a comfortable leather couch. He gestured to the waiter to serve the chilled champagne, which he put in the silver cooler on the table before them. Jill felt both chic and rude, for as she sat down her bare cunt came into contact with the expensive but cool leather, sending a thrill through her lower belly. As they sat there sipping the ice–cold champagne and eating the delicious canap�s, she related the details of her journey, explaining why she had arrived in such a state of randiness. It was as well that the small visitors' room was deserted for as she spoke she hiked up her skirt so Ian could see her thighs, crotch, and a glimpse of her bare cunt. Glancing at his crotch she could see the effect that her story was having; she could see the big bulge steadily getting bigger. The realization of the power she was exercising spurred her to be more daring, so that as she related the story she illustrated her words with action. When she said, "I had to hold myself" she raised her skirt, placed her hand between her legs, then "I crossed my legs and squeezed," she did just that, then "I put two fingers up my cunt" Ian gasped as she demonstrated. However when it came to saying "I could not hold my pee and I was leaking," not wanting to be too rude she raised her skirt higher and taking her glass and poured a little champagne over her lower belly so that it ran down over her shaven cunt through her already wet crack and on to the leather, soaking her suspender belt straps and stocking tops. Then, taking a white napkin she placed it between her legs to resemble a panty crotch, saying "so I was wetting myself, like this" and she poured more wine so that the napkin had the appearance of wet panties. By this time the champagne was exciting her in more than one way, while what she had drank made her heady, that which she had poured over her cunt was stimulating her lips and clit, so that the two fingers still embedded inside her were beginning to be used in covert masturbation. Her words were now coming in gasps "by that time I was almost coming." She had not intended going all the way, but found the sensations she had aroused were now too strong to resist and was now finger fucking herself to a quite delightful orgasmic state. Ian now no longer content to just watch, dropped to his knees and forced his head between her legs and replaced her fingers with his mouth which was filled with champagne so in order to use his tongue, he first squirted the wine up in to her in a cold spurt that took her over the top. Wriggling her bottom and ejaculating so much wine, pee, and come onto his face that his mouth could not hold it all; she watched it drip down his chin and into the napkin. His nostrils were filled with the aroma of pee, come, champagne, and perfume. He raised his face to hers and with mouths locked together she sucked the tribute of their ministrations into her own mouth and swallowed it. They had just time to make themselves decent before the waiter arrived, to ask if there was anything else that they wanted. They ordered a further bottle of bubbly, which they drank more slowly, Ian taking good care to see that Jill drank most of it. When they left the club Jill deliberately avoided going to the toilet even though she needed to go. Which was a naughty thing to do, but as she guessed, likely to lead to something nice which it did. After all, Ian had not found any release at the club, and when they got around to doing something about that, Ian would expect her to be prepared. They did take care of Ian, but that's another story.
