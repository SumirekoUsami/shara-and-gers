PART 1 

Okay I have yet to try this but have wanted to for some time. Now that I am out on Xmas break, I am going to try to do this tonight. I'll post on how it goes! Btw, I'm wearing Khaki pants and light black/ greayish colored panties. Wish me luck!

PART 2

I started this at 11:15 PM lastnight and have held my pee since then. The first 10 or so hours went with no needing to go due to me being asleep. I awoke around 10:30 Am with a slight urge to pee. I ignored it and went about me daily business. It wasn't until around 6:30 when I was starting to get really desperate to pee. I was starting to fidget and sit up more straight to help release pressure on my bladder. With every passing minute my slight urge to pee went to utter desperation by 9:30. I was starting to cross my legs and holding my bladder. Finally 11:15. I could go to the bathroom. But...I didn't. I kept holding. It was only maybe 10-15 minutes before I lost control and wet myself. I had on a a pair of pink jogging pants and pink panties. I went all pink so it would show nicely if I did wet myself before my time was up. I'm probably going to attempt a 30 hour hold by spring break. (March30-April 15)
