21–year–old woke up one morning and tossed off her sheets, which were slightly damp. She reached down and felt the bottom of her light blue cotton thong, which was fairly dry, but still a little damp. She cursed her small bladder and got out of bed, her long blonde hair flowing down to just above her tight little ass. She shook out of her panties, letting them drop the floor, and ripped the sheets off the bed, moving to the kitchen and putting them in the washer. She noticed the time was 8:50 and wanted to leave at 9 for her shopping, so she ran back into her room and threw open her drawer, grabbing a pair of pink cotton bikini panties, pulling them over her long legs and covering her delicate bush. Then she grabbed a matching bra and covered up her perky 32C tits. She threw on a pair of blue jeans and a black halter–top, stuffed the money on her dresser in her pocket, grabbed her keys, and went back to the kitchen. It was 8:55, so she quickly ate a doughnut and gulped down a glass of orange juice and out the door she went. It was such a beautiful day and it wasn&#8217;t a terribly far walk to town, so she thought a walk was in order. On the way there, she stopped at a local convenience store and picked up a 2 liter bottle of Mountain Dew, and much to her surprise, finished it by the time she was in town! She tossed it out and went in the first shop, feeling her small bladder slowly fill up. She went from shop to shop, each time coming out with a bag or 2. Finally it was about 1pm and she was getting tired and sat down on a bench. She grabbed her stomach near her bladder and thought she should walk the mile down to the restrooms. Just as she was about to get up and leave, her friend Daria came walking up the sidewalk and noticed Britney holding her stomach. They chatted for a while with Britney still holding on, and then Daria offered to take Britney out to lunch, thinking she was hungry. Britney gladly accepted, intending on using the caf&#8217;&#8216;s restrooms. So they walked 2 blocks to a little corner caf&#8217; and as soon as they were seated, Britney asked for the restrooms. Much to her horror, the waitress informed her the restroom was out of order! Thinking she could hold it for another half an hour, Britney ordered a cold turkey sandwich and a coffee. After their meal was finished, they stayed and talked awhile longer and Britney put down another cup of coffee. They were finally ready to leave and when Britney stood up– a short hot gush of piss came out and lightly dampened her panties. Britney was terrified, quickly said goodbye to Daria and was then stood outside the caf&#8217;, knowing that the restroom facilities were still almost a mile away. It was now 2pm and the streets were busy with people walking on them and cars going by. She figured she could either try to make it, or wet herself there and humiliate herself, then have to walk home like that. So, she slowly started to walk down the sidewalk. About half a block away, a strong surge ran through her body– making her stop and grab between her legs, squeezing tightly. Some may have come out, she wasn&#8217;t sure, she only saw the people look at her movements. After she gained control, she started to walk again. At the end of the block, traffic at the intersection was bad and she had to stand and wait to cross the street, crossing her legs tightly. When traffic was clear and she went to move, a long stream burst out of her. She thought she was done for as she desperately tried to get control, but she managed to. When she checked the damage, she felt the bottom of her panties were wet and there was a wet patch between her legs, but she knew she could hide that. She stood up straight and kept walking, feeling the pain intensify, and short spurts coming out every few steps. She made it about a quarter of a mile when she couldn&#8217;t move anymore. She stood there against a wall with her legs crossed and her hand between them, squeezing tightly. She turned red knowing that she couldn&#8217;t make it the last half–mile and that she was about to wet her pants in front of all those people. She could feel spurts coming out of her even as she was standing there holding herself. Her hand was filling up with warm liquid and she looked down. She saw the front of her crotch wet and if her hand weren&#8217;t there, people would be able to see it. She tried to think of something to do, but the only thing she could think of was to rip her jeans off and squat down and pee right there through her panties. Either way she was going to wet herself in front of these people, but if she did that, at least she wouldn&#8217;t have to walk home in soaked jeans with people staring. She set her bags down so her other hand would be free and started to fidget with the button on her jeans. It was hard since she wasn&#8217;t used to it and she didn&#8217;t dare move her other hand. Frustrated, she couldn&#8217;t get the button undone. Then as she was just about to get it, a loud clang from a trash can lid falling made her jump and that was the end. Pee just came gushing out of her like a jet, soaking her panties and slowly spreading down to her ankles and splashing out of her hand. She turned beet red and was too much in shock to move her hand away as she looked at the people&#8217;s faces. When she was finally empty she looked down and saw that she was totally soaked and standing in a huge puddle. She hung her head in shame, hearing some people take pity on her, but most of them were saying it was disgusting and that she should grow up. She grabbed her bags, knowing she&#8217;d get the same treatment on the long walk home.<br />
