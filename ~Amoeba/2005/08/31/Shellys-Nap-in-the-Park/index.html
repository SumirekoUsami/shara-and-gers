                <p>20–year–old Shelly never could stand the sound of running water ever since she was a little girl. Even when she goes to the gas station she has to hold her crotch like a little girl because the faint sound of the gasoline running through the pump sends almost uncontrollable impulses to pee right through her. Even when she just gets done peeing, if she flushes the toilet she needs to go again; she also has to cross her beautiful legs very tightly to wash her hands.<br />
And speaking of her beautiful legs, they look ever so sexy today. Nice and tan&#8230;you can look at them until her short baby blue fuzzy shorts don&#8217;t allow you to look any more (and those shorts don&#8217;t hide too much.) The shorts definitely showed off her ass, too (that and the fact that she wasn&#8217;t wearing any panties. Something she enjoys doing is sitting there and letting the guys wonder if she&#8217;s wearing any or not.) She sits at the caf&#8217;, sipping at her tea, knowing full well the guys are scoping out her legs, ass, and her perky 32 C breasts that fit nicely inside her pink camisole top. She smiled into her cup as she took another sip.<br />
She finished and as she got up to pay the bill, she hit her knee off the table. She bent down to grab her knee and could feel how many eyes were watching her bend over. After a moment, she walked over and paid her bill. On her way back to the street, she passed one guy that couldn&#8217;t help it and she felt the pinch on her ass. She didn&#8217;t bother to make a scene and just walked out the door. She walked over to the park and spread a blanket out on the grassy field. The park was a bit crowded, but she didn&#8217;t care, she just wanted to lie there and show off her body. She watched guys jog by checking her out and people sitting close by watching her and she smiled, laying on the blanket and drifting off to sleep.<br />
What she didn&#8217;t realize when she set up the blanket is that there was a water fountain very close to her hidden by a tree and people visited it quite often on this hot day. In her sleep, she didn&#8217;t realize why she was discomforted, all she knew was something was wrong. Every time somebody took a drink, her legs shifted to close her crotch up. When a jogger stopped for about a full 2 minutes, her hand ended up between her legs with her legs squeezed tightly. She could feel the discomfort in her sleep but didn&#8217;t know what was wrong; all she knew was that she was uncomfortable. She shifted from side to side, the desperation growing in her bladder without Suzie knowing at all.<br />
The people around her noticed, though. Some watched with excitement, some in disbelief, some feeling sorry for her, but none of them thought of waking her up and nobody realized it was the water fountain at fault. Another person took a drink and she clamped hard on her crotch, squirming and making a hard face. In her sleep she knew something was about to happen, but didn&#8217;t know what. She was really worried. Then suddenly, the worry was gone. She felt so relieved, and it showed in her face. A smile came across her from ear to ear and her face lit up she was so relieved. She didn&#8217;t know what made her uncomfortable, but it was gone, and she was happy.<br />
In reality, her bladder had given up and she started to wet herself. It didn&#8217;t even start slowly with a small spot&#8230;as soon as she started her shorts were pretty much soaked and it spread across the blanket. People gasped as they watched, some guys got obvious boners, some people made comments, and so on. They watched her smile like she was a little girl with a lollipop. The blanket was really soaked and when she turned over, her hand splashed right on it. She jolted up from the shock and looked at everyone around her, then looked down. She turned red and immediately knew what the discomfort was, but she didn&#8217;t know how it had happened. She only had one cup of tea.<br />
Then she realized something else. She remembered a big smile coming across her face when she felt relieved. These people around her must think she&#8217;s a sick, disgusting person. She didn&#8217;t even cry she was in so much shock looking at everyone around her. Finally her voice found her way to her throat, &#8220;I&#8230;I had a wet dream.&#8221; She looked down, away from the people. She had a weird feeling come over her&#8230;she kind of liked the fact that she had a wet dream; having no control over her bladder at all and the feeling of great discomfort followed by extreme relief. And all the people around watching her turned her on even more. She looked back up around at the guys, looking for the ones that were obviously turned on by the mishap. She stood up and walked over to one.<br />
&#8220;I had an accident,&#8221; she said in a sweet voice. The guy nodded. &#8220;Do you think we could go back to your place and get me cleaned up?&#8221;<br />
The guy smiled and she grabbed him by the shirt and pulled him into her, making sure her soaked shorts pressed against his dry ones.<br />
&#8220;Oops, now we both need to get clean,&#8221; she said devilishly and the two walked off together.<br />
