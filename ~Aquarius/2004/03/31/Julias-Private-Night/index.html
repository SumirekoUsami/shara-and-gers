            <div class="mt-4">
                <p>Julia watches herself in the mirror in the staff bathroom. Big meeting in half an hour, and as the new director of marketing she knows she has to make a good impression. She knows that is was her qualifications that got her the job, but looking okay is no disadvantage, right? Her hair is dark and curly and gathered in a ponytail, she is wearing a grey suit – a jacket and a straight skirt – above a white blouse, and her make–up is very discreet. She is a proper lady of twenty–five, single, who keeps a friendly distance to her suitors at work.<br />
Julia straightens her skirt and drinks a couple of mugs of water from the cooler. It&#8217;s Friday. She&#8217;s ready for the meeting.<br />
Afterwards they are served sandwiches and coffee, and Evian for those who would like that. Julia doesn&#8217;t leave lipstick marks on her cup and glass. Four thirty, weekend coming on. She hasn&#8217;t used the toilet since twelve thirty. A couple of things on her desk are in need of her attention– then two phone calls, and saving the documents on her computer. Her boss passes her door and gives her an encouraging nod: Good work.<br />
Her working week is finished. Now begins Julia&#8217;s own special weekend. The things they don&#8217;t know, she thinks. And they don&#8217;t. Julia lives her weekends behind closed doors and curtained – no, almost curtained – windows. Alone.<br />
Her preparations are a great part of her pleasure; one of them is drinking profusely at work and putting off her visit to the ladies&#8217;. She noticed a slight need at the end of the meeting, but not strong enough to take her mind off work. Now she knows she has to go soon.<br />
She gives some instructions to her secretary and writes a sharp note to the logistics manager. She shuts down her Mac, closes the lights and leaves.<br />
Julia does not wait for the bus on Fridays. It&#8217;s a forty–minute walk to her flat, and this is her version of extreme sports – getting home without peeing herself.<br />
While walking she removes the elastic from her hair, shaking it loose. She looks at her reflection in a shop window, smiling slyly to herself. A proper girl in the management who is careful with alcohol, never kissing up to the managing director at office parties, never dating co–workers, and never showing more than a discreet amount of nylon knees to business associates.<br />
If only they knew.<br />
Julia has to pee, but she does not hurry. The pressure in her bladder adds to her expectations and triggers her lust, and she knows she is going to enjoy herself this evening. Alone.<br />
To test herself she enters the mall a few blocks from her flat. Slipping her hands across lingerie and tights, holding up dresses and skirts and fingering a pair of tan leggings. In the food department she purchases a six–pack of non–alcoholic beer and a few bottles of mineral water. Her skirt is tight across her belly. She has to reach home very soon. She has to clench her muscles as she is leaving the mall, and she feels her cheeks blushing slightly. In the elevator she releases a small squirt in her panties, and she shivers at the thought of anybody waiting up on the seventh floor. Julia enters her flat and closes the door, rubs her belly and lets go a tiny dribble. In her bedroom she hangs her suit in the closet – no stains – and puts her blouse with the laundry. She will have to do some washing tomorrow. Wearing panties, tights and bra she heads for the kitchen to put away her purchases. She doesn&#8217;t know if she is seen from the block of flats across the street. She doesn&#8217;t care. She is desperate to pee. She makes tea, puts a mug of water to cool in the fridge, and pops a beer. Almost writhing on the kitchen chair she drinks, looking forward to a hot bath. Her back is arched as she clenches her knees, then she spreads her legs and holds herself. It feels hot and wet as she releases a controlled squirt while stroking herself. She reaches the evening&#8217;s first light orgasm, like a preamble to the night&#8217;s pleasures.<br />
Now she has to. She downs her beer, rises carefully and enters the bathroom, meeting her own eyes in the big mirror. Her cheeks are rosy, her breathing shallow; her crotch is dark and the white nylon panties are almost transparent underneath her thin tights. Holding her own stare she sits on the toilet and lets go. The fabric is hot under her bottom. Still sitting she slips a hand beneath the elastic and rubs herself to another orgasm.<br />
Julia lets out her breath. There are more things to do before she can slip into the tub. With her butt all wet she fetches candles and body lotion, shaving kit, bath bubbles, shampoo and towels. She fetches another beer from the fridge and enters the guest room. Her bed is not ready, and she picks what she needs from the closet. Rubber sheet, a couple of big bath towels, extra flannel sheets. Her TV and <span class="caps">DVD</span> are ready, the remote on the nightstand, and there are magazines in the drawer. Nothing vulgar or crude, only beautiful bodies both dressed and undressed. Images to feed her imagination.<br />
From her bedroom she brings various pieces of clothing. A loose dress, a miniskirt, leggings, pants, her new catsuit, bike shorts, jeans, leotard. She sips from a big glass of water as she contemplates her garments. What to do tonight, a round of the bars? A trip to the pictures, or maybe just take a long walk? Or a good run around the block– with the option of slipping into the park to squat behind the hedge.<br />
There is no rush to decide. First she will have a bath. She drains her glass and pours a mug of tea while drawing her bath, she turns off the light and lights the candles. She strips, putting the soiled underwear in the laundry basket. She walks naked into the kitchen and fetches a bottle of champagne.<br />
Julia enjoys herself. Lying in the hot water under the fragrant bubbles she leaves through a magazine, drinking sparkling wine. She has to pee, and lets go in the bath water. The champagne lifts her spirits, she feels light and open, and slips a hand between her legs. The beautiful girls in the magazine share her orgasm.<br />
Time for grooming– she shaves her legs, loving to take care of her body. The soft skin in her armpits feels tender and sensitive after shaving; she strokes her smooth skin, letting her hands slip over her breasts as well. She folds her legs underneath her, lifts her pelvis, and removes all growth of hair. The silky smoothness! She parts her lips with her finger and pees, a thin golden arc from her sex. Then she pulls the plug, showers, lathers herself and rinses. The champagne bottle is nearly empty as she steps out of the tub a little unsteadily. She wraps herself in a giant towel and fetches more tea.<br />
After drying she rubs herself with body lotion. She smells soft and feminine, with a slight hint of arousal. She strokes her slit and smells her fingers. Imagines another woman&#8217;s smell – or another woman&#8217;s fingers.<br />
Julia has had boyfriends, and maybe someday she will find the man in her life. But in her dreams, in the fantasies she is acting out, she has her mind on girl pleasures. Soft and tender and secret, in flowing garments, crossing their legs before helping each other with buttons and zippers in the girls&#8217; room. She pictures Tina, her friend from school, who often slept over. They used to lie embracing, fondling each other, rubbing breasts and bellies, helping each other with careful fingers in moist slits. Tina often dribbled when making extra effort, and Julia will never forget the first time she saw her friend&#8217;s running shorts get wet. The excitement hit her like an electric shock– she threw her arms around Tina and rubbed against her. That was the first time Julia peed her pants on purpose, in solidarity. She has been doing it since. Tina has moved, and occasionally Julia has met and had sex with other girls, but usually she got the most pleasure from herself and her recollections. Yes, there was Vicky; they used to pee on each other in the shower, and play hold–it when out on the town. Julia pictures the time Vicky didn&#8217;t make it, but flooded her jeans in line for the restrooms. Her fingers search for her pleasure spot and find it.<br />
She has to pee again. She picks her bike shorts and puts them on in front of the mirror. The matching top squeezes her small breasts, and her lips are showing through the fabric. She turns her back to the mirror, strutting her butt, stroking her cheeks and her crack. Turns back. Feels it begin to flow, holds back, lets go, watches the wetness spread. She stands with her feet apart, stretches her arms, soaks herself.<br />
Julia drops her towel in the pool on the floor. She turns and looks at her butt and the telling the dark shade between her legs. I have peed myself, she thinks. I have peed myself on purpose. She fondles her wet, swollen lips through the fabric before undressing again. Naked, with pee drops on her thighs, she fetches more to drink and enters the bedroom. She puts on panties and bra and the green catsuit, and picks up the remote. She sits cross–legged on a big towel on the bed, tea mug and water glass beside her, and presses play.<br />
Soft bodies emerge on the screen and there is a couple on the balcony having drinks. They start necking and fondling, he slips his hand under her dress, but just as he is going to remove her panties the doorbell rings. It&#8217;s the neighbor girl, crying because her boyfriend has left her. They ask her in, serve her drinks, and they sit talking on the sofa. The girl is dressed in tight cutoffs, and the woman puts a hand on her thigh.<br />
Julia releases a small squirt.<br />
The man strokes the girl&#8217;s hair while the woman holds her hands. When the man leaves, the woman kisses the girl on her mouth.<br />
Julia pees a little again. She knows what is coming.<br />
The girl obviously has to pee, as she is curling her legs and holding her belly. The woman takes the girl&#8217;s hand and rises, and they both head for the bathroom. But the door is locked, as the man is inside. The girl twists and clenches her thighs. The woman is also looking in need of a pee– she is holding herself beneath her short dress.<br />
Julia touches herself as the woman is reaching out for the girl, putting her hand in her crotch. The girl is rubbing against her. Then she looks anxiously in the camera, and Julie sees the cutoffs turn dark with pee. Julia lets go, too.<br />
The woman sinks to her haunches and kisses the girl&#8217;s wet crotch. Suddenly a small pool appears underneath her. She lifts her dress and shows the girl – and Julia – her wet panties. They kiss again, both of them wriggling as they struggle to hold their pee. Sobbing, the girl loses control and floods her cutoffs. The woman kneels in front of her. Then the girl lies down on the floor, and the woman squats over her and pees on her. When the man emerges from the bathroom Julia uses the remote. She rubs herself hard as the next sequence starts. Here the same girl is dressed in a school uniform, she has been detained, and her teacher is the woman from the previous scene. The girl raises her hand because she needs the bathroom, but her Miss says no. The girl keeps writhing, getting more and more desperate, twisting on her chair, needing a wee. She slips a hand under her skirt, being so desperate, but she is not allowed. Julia sees that the teacher herself has a hand up her skirt, rubbing herself as she is watching the young girl, sobbing, clenching her legs. Then she cannot hold it anymore, and she weeps as pee drips from her chair. Miss orders her to stand up and lift her skirt. Her panties are soaked, and Miss tells her off. The girl has to lean forward on her desk as Miss lifts her skirt and slaps her wet bottom. The slaps turn into caresses. Miss puts her hand between the girl&#8217;s legs and rubs her. Then Miss sits on her desk with her legs spread, and the girl licks her panty–less crotch, drinking her pee.<br />
Julia pinches her nipples and pees herself in short squirts. She moans loudly as she comes, holding her hand in the hot flow. The smell of her pee adds to her pleasure.<br />
She changes again, into a long dress over a lacy bodysuit, drinks a can of beer and leaves the flat. She feels in the mood for the piano bar, with soft music, nice dresses, and no over–eager guys trying to pick her up. Actually, she got picked up once, in the ladies. By a curvy, fair woman in her thirties who wanted to share a cubicle with her. You go first, she had said, I want to watch you wee. Trembling, Julia unbuttoned her pants, letting them fall to her ankles before pulling her red silk panties slowly down. Her naked sex throbbed with desire and need, and she sat down with her legs spread and relieved herself. When it was her turn the fair woman lifted her skirt and sat – she had nothing under – and pulled Julia close, holding her butt and licking her slit while peeing. Afterwards they danced, and Julia spent the night at her place. The woman, Lisa, had licked her to incredible climaxes and had drunk from her hot springs.<br />
Tonight nobody catches her interest. She drinks another glass of white wine and an Evian before heading for home. Through the park she takes her shoes off and walks barefoot on the grass. She has to pee and enjoys it. Feels the pressure in her bladder and her tight muscles struggling. Should she squat somewhere? Gather her dress around her waist, unbutton her bodysuit and water the grass? Or hold it until she gets home?<br />
There are too many people about. She dreams of peeing in the grass while people watch, but she will not do it.<br />
But she is so desperate. She stops by a tree. Anybody coming? A couple is strolling. A dog is barking. There is a man on that bench. And there is a girl behind a bush, with her jeans down and her butt bare–naked– eighteen, maybe nineteen years old and with long auburn hair and small breasts. Julia feels the warmth down her legs. The girl doesn&#8217;t see her, and if she had, she could not know that the elegant woman is peeing herself. The girl shakes her butt and pulls up her jeans before running along. Julia watches the denim butt disappear, breathing deeply.<br />
She locks herself in. Slips out of her dress and fetches a beer. Her bladder is filling up already. She drinks fast, and opens another bottle. Removes the wet towel from the bed and puts on a new one. Drinks a glass of water, puts on water to make tea. She watches another film, featuring girls on the beach changing into swimsuits, touching each other, peeing in bikinis and one–pieces.<br />
Julia is quite tipsy, and really needs to pee.<br />
Time for bed–<br />
She removes her wet bodysuit and puts on white cotton panties and cotton tights, downs a last glass of water before slipping under the sheets. She is tired and bursting.<br />
In the dream she is in a big room, naked, squatting in the middle of the floor. She wakes just before the pee starts flowing. In the next dream she is opening the door of a bathroom and preparing to sit down before slipping out of sleep again.<br />
The next time she wakes she is wet.<br />
She wraps herself in the sheets and puts her hand between her legs. She is warm and drowsy and satisfied. Then she relaxes.<br />
Slowly, softly, Julia wets the bed.<br />
