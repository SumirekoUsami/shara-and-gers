                <p>Mike walked into Jan’s office; she’d been expecting him and had been saving her pee for most of the morning. It’s a little later than her usual lunch time, but she’s arranged to take a late lunch because she’s meeting a friend from out of town. He’s been holding his pee too, though not as long, and he feel the pressure as he greets her, cordially but not passionately because her office mate is there. They leave her office and head for the elevator. The door opens and they step in. As it closes, leaving them alone, he looks at her and grins, giving his semi–hard penis a little tweak. She grins back, raising one knee and crossing it in front of the other.<br />
A dump truck full of gravel rumbles down a street several blocks away, headed for a construction site. As it rolls into the site it hits a jagged chunk of concrete, blowing its worn front tire. Out of control, it careens into a utility pole, snapping it like a matchstick. The power lines snap like rubber bands.<br />
The lights in the office building dim and die, and the elevator grinds to a halt. The emergency light blinks on, and they stand there, wondering how long this outage might last. In his own office building, outages are so common that he keeps a flashlight in his desk drawer, but they’re usually brief. He glances at his watch. It’s about 1:30. <br />
He opens the door but it’s midway between floors, and the outer doors are out of reach. The phone is dead. They’re stuck.<br />
For a while, they engage in desultory conversation, trying to distract themselves and each other from the increasing pressure in out bladders. They had both been anticipating a walk in the park and eventual relief, not an involuntary wait in a stalled elevator . . . <br />
Before too long, she admits that she has to pee. This both arouses and distresses him, because if she lets fly in there, there’ll be no concealing it, and further, they’ll be confined with the aroma, which isn’t too bad unconfined, but in this close space . . . . he remains in denial for a while, but finally admits that he’s in the same boat as herself, and they both laugh softly, not wanting to laugh too hard because that makes it harder to hold on. He glances at his watch. It’s about 2:00. <br />
For a while, they lean against the walls of the elevator, pressing their legs together, trying to contain and minimize the growing discomfort in their groins. This wasn’t what he was anticipating, darn it! Seeing her hips twitch and squirm, and seeing she biting her lip, has the combined effect of increasing his own discomfort and his arousal. The two make a very strange combination, one that would be welcome under different circumstances . . . <br />
She crosses her legs, and leans forward a little. he does the same, though it does him little good. Once in a while he presses on the front of his penis, which seems to ease the urge for a moment or two. They’re breathing shallowly, trying to keep all the pressures as low as possible. He glances at his watch. It’s about 2:30.<br />
He starts to scan the floor, and notices that there seems to be a section of carpet that’s a different color. he kneels by it and probes around its edges with his pocket knife. It peels up and he find a tiny opening, covered by a panel, in the floor. Fumbling with the blade of the knife, he manages to unscrew the bolts holding it in place and remove it. It’s an access panel for the cable, big enough to reach through but not to fall through. He looks at her and nods toward the hole. She shakes her head. He shrugs and sits back against the wall, his legs stretched out in front of him and crossed. From there he can actually see up her skirt. His penis is fairly screaming for relief, but he don’t feel right letting she continue to suffer while he relieves himself. He glances at his watch. It’s about 3:00.<br />
But finally he can take it no longer. Standing, he steps astride of the hole and takes his penis out. He has to lean forward to aim it at the hole, and only after some pushing can he get the pee started, but soon it’s flowing down the hole. The only sound, at first, is the very faint hiss as it shoots out, but when the pee finally reaches the bottom of the elevator shaft, several stories down, the distinctive trickling noise floats up through the hole. With a murmured complaint, she claps her hand over her groin, but it’s too late, the pee is trickling down her legs. She steps up to the hole, forcing him to step back. As he continues to pee into the hole, angling his stream to hit it, she squats over it and lets her pee flow through her panties and into the hole, her stream mingling with his.<br />
He finishes before she does, and steps back from the hole, fascinated by her continuation. With a look of profound relief, she pushes out the last couple of squirts and stands up, pulling her panties off and dropping them into the hole. They look at each other and laugh, then embrace, their relieved bladders now relishing the pressure from outside.<br />
He replaces the cover over the hole, leaving the screws out, and flips the carpet back into place. They sit side by side now, softly kissing and caressing, until the lights abruptly come back on and the elevator resumes its journey to the ground floor. He glances at his watch. It’s about 3:30.<br />
They exit with reasonable composure and head for the park, not sure what they will do, but certain to enjoy their walk! Captain Red.</p>            </div>
