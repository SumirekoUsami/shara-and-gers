                <p>Bruce was to pick Nancy up at 5:00 PM. It was midsummer and Bruce had gotten off early from work. So Bruce went to his favorite bar to while the hours away until it became time to pick Nancy up from her place of employment.<br />
Bruce enjoyed a few beers at his favorite bar. As a matter of fact he enjoyed too many beers. When he left to pick Nancy up he had already violated the rule of six. The rule of six means that when you have had six beers you will probably need to pee. And, when you answer that need all subsequent needs become very urgent needs. In short, while the first pee when beer drinking can be put off for a long time the next and all subsequent calls to pee are urgent. Once one has acknowledged the fact that one must pee one becomes faced with the fact that an urge to pee is not something to be toyed with. After six or so beers the need to pee is more than a need; it is desperation. When Bruce left to go downtown to pick Nancy up he only slightly needed to go to the bathroom but by the time Nancy came out to join him the need to go was fairly desperate. He had promised Nancy that he would take her to a really great place where they could listen to great music and drink beer and have great steaks for dinner. This was going to be an evening to remember. But, Bruce had forgotten the influence a few beers could have on one&#8217;s evening.<br />
Nancy was on time and as she slid into the car in her straight and slick skirt, blouse and heels she was an appealing figure. Bruce thought that he was the luckiest guy in the world for having her company. Bruce also noticed that his need to pee was growing rapidly. He was supposed to take Nancy to their preferred bar for a few beers and to a Dinner Theater for dinner and a play. As he wheeled out from Nancy&#8217;s workplace he noticed an overwhelming need to pee. Bruce&#8217;s slight urge upon leaving the bar was becoming an overwhelming urge. Bruce simply had to pee and he needed to pee badly. He didn&#8217;t want Nancy to know how badly he had to pee so he kept quiet.<br />
The trip out through several miles of four–lane divided highway was a trip indeed. Bruce was shifting lanes and shifting away from what he thought would be slow moving vehicles at traffic lights. He was driving in such a way as to keep from sitting still for too long a time. He had to pee so badly that he was sure that an extended stay at a traffic light would result in a disaster that would mortify him, especially with Nancy sitting next to him. He was frantically trying to think of a place where he could pee without it being too obvious that he sought out that place for that purpose. He desperately needed to pee and he also didn&#8217;t want Nancy to know how desperately he needed to pee.<br />
Finally caught by a traffic light he squirmed until he got a green light and then he pulled over into a shopping center. He knew that a department store in that center had a public restroom and he decided that he would try to get to that restroom.<br />
Nancy asked, &#8220;Why are you stopping here?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I have a package to pick up,&#8221; he replied. He opened the car door and swung his legs out and as he stood up he lost control of his bladder. He peed and peed his khaki pants. He peed his pants until he no longer had to pee. He was standing by his car and he had the door open to conceal his disaster from the public but Nancy was well aware of his accident. &#8220;Goddamn it, I just pissed all over myself,&#8221; he wailed. &#8220;I tried and tried to hold it and I just couldn&#8217;t. I&#8217;d give anything if I hadn&#8217;t done it in front of you, Jesus Christ you must think I am a big loser. I can&#8217;t take you anywhere like this. Jeez, I&#8217;ve gotta change my clothes.&#8221;<br />
Nancy just said that she was OK with his accident, as she had had a few herself. &#8220;You are wet now and we will take care of that, so put that into a place where I can draw out your wet pants against mine when I have a similar problem.&#8221;<br />
At the time it didn&#8217;t mean much to Bruce. He was standing beside his car and his pants were wet from the crotch to the ankles. He was as humiliated as he could be but unknown to him Nancy would later show him an even greater degree of humiliation. Nancy to this day had never learned to control her bladder. Bruce was learning that he and Nancy were made for each other. They had both had wetting accidents in front of each other. He was still struggling with the notion that boys/men weren&#8217;t supposed to wet their pants in public and especially not in front of their dates. He thought that girls were allowed to commit such humiliating practices. But, while he was driving to his apartment he realized that Nancy had already humiliated herself in front of him and he thought that these experiences, while not common, did happen on occasion. He also thought that Nancy must have been as extremely humiliated when she wet herself as he was now. But, he just couldn&#8217;t bring himself to believe that her accident equaled his in humiliation. The wetness of his khakis pushing against him was mortifying beyond compare.<br />
Sensing his embarrassment, Nancy sought to assuage his predicament. His face was flushed and she knew he wanted to go off somewhere and die. She knew because she had been there before. She had been there with Bruce. She reached over and grabbed his penis through the soaked pants and squeezed and his penis reacted by getting very hard.<br />
He said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not supposed to wet myself now that I am a grown man. Goddamn it this was not supposed to happen. Can&#8217;t you see the position I am in? I am driving to my apartment to change my clothes when I should be driving you to a great date. I am driving to my apartment because I pissed myself like a little kid, for Chrissakes.&#8221;<br />
Nancy squeezed harder on his khaki clad penis feeling droplets of urine pouring into her hand. He really was soaked. &#8220;Why is it so bad for you to have a wetting accident and OK for me to have a wetting accident?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Because, he answered, &#8220;I&#8217;m a guy and you&#8217;re a girl. Guys aren&#8217;t supposed to wet themselves but girls can. Girl golfers, girl track stars, girl tennis players, girl flyers.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;When is the last time you saw one of those girls wet themselves?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Yes, some girls may have a problem with bladder control but some guys do also. I saw more boys wet themselves in school than girls. And, I may have seen more grown men in wet pants than grown girls. Can you list an equal number of experiences where girls are more often wet in public than guys?&#8221; <br />
Bruce had to think long and hard before answering. &#8220;As a matter of fact, he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve only seen one girl wet herself in public in my entire life.&#8221;<br />
Nancy replied, &#8220;The defense rests.&#8221;<br />
Bruce came back with, &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t make my wet pants feel any better and it doesn&#8217;t help me with the fact that I lost a great deal of masculinity today. I must admit that I would like to draw myself into a fetal position into a dark corner and suck my thumb, but I won&#8217;t do such a thing.&#8221;<br />
Nancy said, &#8220;Ditto for me when I had my accident the other day. Just keep thinking about it and you will see that there isn&#8217;t a real difference between you and me wetting ourselves. Let&#8217;s just keep the possibility in perspective and keep in mind that wet pants do not indicate a lesser human being. Just one who perhaps waited too long or maybe tempted fate too much.&#8221; She squeezed a bit more and said, &#8220;This could be the start of a beautiful friendship.&#8221; <br />
Sensing another need to go, Bruce began to drive with a sense of anticipation. His soggy pants weren&#8217;t so soggy now that Nancy was holding them in her lovely hands and if he had another accident before he got to his apartment it would not be so humiliating. So much for the trappings of manhood– &#8220;I did indeed pee all over myself in front of my date and I am probably going to have the best sex in my life.&#8221; Amen to wetting my pants. <br />
