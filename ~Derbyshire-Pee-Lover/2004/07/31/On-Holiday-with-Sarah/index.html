                <p>This is my first attempt at posting here – hope you like it. This is also a fantasy – there is no Sarah and the events portrayed are completely fictitious.<br />
I&#8217;d been going out with Sarah for quite some time, and we had a fairy normal boyfriend/girlfriend relationship in all respects. I had never mentioned my interest in watersports and I&#8217;d never had the slightest indication that she was interested either. Then one day we decided to go to the seaside. We wanted somewhere fairly secluded, so the trip turned into a long weekend in Cornwall. I don&#8217;t remember exactly where we ended up – we stayed at a B&amp;B in Truro, but we drove for quite a while before we found what we were looking for. The beach was perfect – a wide bay with a fabulous sandy beach and the sea wasn&#8217;t too rough either. We aren&#8217;t surfers and I think we ended up on the Cornish south coast, rather than the Atlantic coast. Anyway, the day was perfect – the sun beat down and because we were so far from anywhere there weren&#8217;t that many people around either. The only down side was that there were no shops or cafes and therefore – to my delight – no toilets either.<br />
That wasn&#8217;t a problem to me, as I would just go into the sea and pee there, and I suspect Sarah was doing the same.<br />
In the afternoon we settled on our towels to soak up some rays and that was when it happened. I mentioned that it was a shame that there wasn&#8217;t a shop, as I could just murder an ice cream and Sarah said &#8220;never mind ice cream, I&#8217;m absolutely dying for a pee.&#8221; I tried to stay cool, but my mouth was dry as I said that maybe she should just wade into the water and go there, but she said she didn&#8217;t want to do that as she was nice and dry and she&#8217;d only just put more sun–cream on. This was starting to look very good, but ever the gentleman I suggested looking for somewhere where she could relieve herself in private, but looking up and down the beach it was obvious that wasn&#8217;t possible – there wasn&#8217;t a rock or a tree in sight. In fact, just about the only shelter was from the cars in the car park, but there were lots of people milling around there. I tried to suggest that she waited until there were fewer people around, but it was becoming obvious that she couldn&#8217;t hold on much longer – her hand was straying between her thighs to press her pee–hole.<br />
The only thing I could think of was to dig a hole, pee in it, and then cover it up so we quickly pretended to build a sandcastle. We knelt at opposite sides of the hole, sitting on our ankles, and Sarah quickly dug out the sand between her legs so her bottom was effectively over a small trench. &#8220;Keep a look out&#8221; she said, &#8220;I just can&#8217;t hold it any longer&#8221;. I looked around and told her that the coast was clear then diplomatically turned away – &#8220;don&#8217;t worry about that,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I need you to watch in case someone is coming.&#8221;<br />
Well, the only person in any danger of that was me– I could have entered a pole– vaulting competition at that point in time. Then it happened – with a very slight sigh Sarah shifted position and I could see a darker patch forming at the front of her bikini. In a few seconds a healthy jet of pee was hissing out of her into the sand. I was in heaven watching her pee, but I was also in severe danger of having an accident myself. I tried to think of something else, but it was impossible and with a groan I knew I was close to losing the struggle. &#8220;Take it out – quick,&#8221; said Sarah, so I pulled down the waistband of my shorts just enough to free the very tip of my penis. I didn&#8217;t even need to touch it – the movement of the fabric was enough and I pumped jet after jet of semen into the air, which landed in the hole in the sand, splashing into Sarah&#8217;s rapidly expanding puddle. &#8220;Wow&#8221; she gasped, &#8220;I thought you had to pee too, I didn&#8217;t realize that was going to happen. I guess you like to see me pee then?&#8221; Silly question. What she asked next was a massive surprise though – &#8220;have you ever had a holding on contest with someone?&#8221; I said that I hadn&#8217;t, and with a wicked little smile she said that maybe that was something I would like to try. I replied that I certainly would, and that will be the subject of another posting – soon.<br />
