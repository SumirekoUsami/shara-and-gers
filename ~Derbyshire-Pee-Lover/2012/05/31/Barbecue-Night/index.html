                <p>I had worked with Claire for about three years when these events happened. She was a bubbly, outgoing character, very flirtatious and always willing to share a dirty joke or two.We were never more than work colleagues, friends I suppose, but certainly never romantically involved.It was the middle of a typical British summer and the night of the office barbecue.Surprisingly, it wasn&#8217;t raining, but the promise of storms to come on the weather forecast didn&#8217;t bode well.The barbecue was always held in the large garden of a pub near to the offices, and we basically took the place over for the evening.Plenty of food and plenty of drink was had by all, but eventually it was time to head for home.I had a fairly long walk to my home, but it was pleasant enough.Down the hill into the town, through the main shopping area and then under the railway bridge, past the station and into the estate where I lived.About four miles in all, so it was going to take me the better part of an hour and a half.I made sure that I used the little boy&#8217;s room before I left the pub – the queue for the ladies was quite spectacular by then.There were lots of squirming women and I half considered waiting nearby for a little while in case there were any &#8220;sightings&#8221;, but I thought better of it as it might have been a bit obvious, and I knew most of them quite well.By the time I finally left I could hear thunder rumbling in the distance so I had a fair idea I was going to get a soaking before I got back to my little house.As I set off I thought I could see Claire a hundred or so yards ahead, so I hurried to catch her up.Claire lived some distance away, and normally drove to work, but today she had come by rail and was now hurrying to catch one of the last trains home.I asked what time her train was, and she told me that she had about fifteen minutes to get to the station before the last one left, and given that we were still well over two miles from the station I couldn&#8217;t see how she was going to make it in time.&#8220;With a bit of luck it&#8217;ll be late&#8221;, she said, &#8220;they often are.I would have taken a taxi, but when I rang they said it would be at least forty–five minutes.At least walking I&#8217;ll have half a chance&#8221;.We hurried along the busy main road past closed shops and pubs, but there were still plenty of people about and lots of traffic.Then Claire said something that made my heart skip a beat.&#8220;I wish I&#8217;d queued up for the loo before I left the pub – I&#8217;m absolutely bursting for a wee&#8221;.I said we would keep an eye open for a pub, but it wasn&#8217;t very likely as it was well after 11pm and as it was a Tuesday night everywhere seemed to have shut.The station was in sight in the distance, but we still had quite a long way to go, and Claire seemed to be slowing down rather than hurrying.Then I realised that the reason she was walking so slowly was because she had her knees jammed together.I asked if she was OK and she said that she was absolutely desperate.&#8220;I&#8217;ve been drinking beer all evening, and I only went to the loo once.I don&#8217;t think my bladder has ever been this full – it really starting to hurt now&#8221;.&#8220;I doubt we&#8217;re going to find a pub open now&#8221;, I replied, &#8220;Is there a toilet on the train?&#8221;&#8220;I think so, yes.Don&#8217;t worry too much&#8221;, she said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to have to go behind a car or something soon anyway&#8221;.I felt my cock stiffening in my underwear and put my hand in my pocket to adjust it into a more comfortable position.Just then the rain that had been threatening started to fall, accompanied by more thunder in the distance.&#8220;Oh great&#8221;, said Claire, &#8220;as if things weren&#8217;t bad enough&#8221; then she stopped walking completely and gasped.&#8220;Oh no – I&#8217;m sorry about this, but I&#8217;ve got to stop a moment&#8221;.She had her legs tightly crossed and was squirming like mad, then she lifted up her short skirt, rammed her hand between her legs and groaned, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to have to find somewhere to stop – I&#8217;m just about wetting my knickers&#8221;.I groaned – my cock was absolutely throbbing now and drips of pre–cum were leaking out at the thought of the desperate woman alongside me. &#8220;Are you OK?&#8221; she asked, &#8220;you look a bit flushed&#8221;.I confessed that the idea that she needed a wee was turning me on something rotten, expecting her to be shocked, but instead she just giggled, &#8220;Maybe I should just do it in my pants then&#8221;.I asked her if she had done that before, and she said that she did it quite a lot.&#8220;It&#8217;s the main reason I wear skirts so much – it&#8217;s much easier to have a crafty pee in a skirt than trousers&#8220;We managed to get moving again, and we were getting near to the station now, but just as we thought she might be in luck her train rumbled over the bridge and off into the darkness.&#8220;Oh well, no rush now&#8221;, said Claire, &#8220;but I really do have to pee&#8221;.We walked under the railway bridge and as we came out on the other side she pulled me up a small alley that ran alongside the railway.In the darkness, she put her hand on my cock and squeezed gently.&#8220;Very nice&#8221;, she said, and pushed her hand down the front of my trousers.I felt her cool fingers take hold of the end of my cock and start to rub the foreskin up and down.It was heaven, but I knew it couldn&#8217;t last long – I was so turned on I was practically cumming already.&#8220;I thought you had to pee&#8221; I gasped.&#8220;I am&#8221; she replied &#8220;I&#8217;m doing it in my knickers now&#8221;.I could hear her pee splashing on the ground and that was all it took – my cock twitched in her hand and spat jet after jet of spunk into my underwear.&#8220;Good boy&#8221; she whispered as she carried on peeing through her knickers onto the sodden ground.She ended up staying the night at my place (on the couch!) with her knickers and my undies sharing the washer/dryer.<br />
