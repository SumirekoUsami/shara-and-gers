                <p>I&#8217;m a 31–year–old slim blonde math teacher at this local high school. I remember a really memorable experience I had a while back. When the classes were done for the entire year, the students had to take a math exam this one particular day, and after 3 hours every student had finished the test and left the school. By that point, I had to pee kinda badly. <br />
During the test, I think I had drunk at least a litre and a half of water, and I didn&#8217;t get a chance to use the washroom that morning either because I overslept. Plus, I had drunk around 2 large cups of coffee that morning as well. But I decided to hold it in because I had a lot of exams to grade and such. Even though I could&#8217;ve taken the exams with me and just marked them later, but I preferred to try and get it over with now instead of later. With each exam I grade, the more desperate I&#8217;ve become. &#8220;Fuck, there are a lot of papers to mark!&#8221; After marking about half of the exams, I decided to head to the washroom. I head towards the staff&#8217;s washroom, then noticed that it was out of order, so I went to the girls&#8217; washroom. But once there, I noticed the same thing, an out of order sign was at the door. I quickly head towards the office and asked why are all the washrooms was out of order.<br />
&#8220;It had something to do with a student prank&#8230; apparently the students thought it would be humorous to purposely overflow the toilets throughout the school,&#8221; said the secretary. I felt really frustrated about that considering that I was had an urgent need to take a piss&#8230;<br />
I decided that I should just take the stupid exams with me, grade them later and just bring them back the next day. I hastily went to my car and drove off in search of the nearest public washroom I could find. I knew I wouldn&#8217;t be able to hold it in until I got home, because my place would take around 45 minutes just to get to, and I had to pee badly by that point. <br />
By the time I found a gas station a few minutes later, I parked near it and went to ask for the washroom key. I went straight to the washroom and when I got there, it stunk so badly in there that I could gag&#8230; despite the fact that I had to pee so badly at the time, I decided that I just couldn&#8217;t bear it long enough in there to use the toilet. So I went back inside to give back the key and looked for somewhere else nearby. After a desperate search, I saw a pharmacy and just thought of an idea that I normally wouldn&#8217;t even be considering. I thought that I might as well buy a pack of the most absorbent diapers that they had and just use them. I hesitated for a minute but I knew I was going to lose control of my bladder really soon if I didn&#8217;t do something, so I went in to buy them.<br />
As I walked in, I tried my best to act natural and not to show any sign of my urgency&#8230; I looked around and chose the one that was probably the most absorbent. &#8220;Nice day we&#8217;re having today, huh??&#8221; The cashier asked me kindly. &#8220;It sure is real nice and sunny today!&#8221; I responded, trying my best to respond and not to letting my words swirl or stutter due to my full bladder. <br />
After purchasing them, I said good day, and went bursting into my car&#8230; so to speak. I put one on and even though I knew I couldn&#8217;t hold it in much longer, I was still felt a bit hesitant because this felt really weird– a grown woman in her late 20&#8217;s in this position&#8230; not too common. But I couldn&#8217;t really drive in this predicament, so I decided to quickly get into the backseat because the windows at the back are tinted so nobody can see what I was doing.<br />
Despite the fact that it felt really weird, I started to feel this bizarre pleasure from holding it in. Soon after trying to hold it in, I started peeing just a bit into the diaper. Moments later, I started leaking out larger bursts, and eventually, I lost total control of my bladder. I didn&#8217;t even bother trying to stop it; I just let it naturally flow out. During the entire time, I thought it felt sooooo good relieving my bladder.<br />
After what seemed like an eternity, I had finally finished. I quickly slid the diaper off and quickly drove back to my place. All and all, I actually quite enjoyed this more than I thought&#8230; I knew I would definitely enjoy doing this again in the near future&#8230; but next time, I would test it out with much more fluids going into me&#8230;<br />
A week had passed since the incident at school with me holding a full bladder in during my students&#8217; math exam. Now, I&#8217;ve finally finished my job at the high school, and have been on summer vacation for the past 2 days. One morning when I woke up, I realized that I didn&#8217;t have anything to do, so I had decided that I should test the limits of my bladder. I decided that since I still had the extra diapers I bought last time when I was desperate; I could try using them again since I don&#8217;t know any good spots I could go other than the bathroom. <br />
Anyways, since I had awoke from bed that morning, I had drunk a bit of water whenever I could, and I made sure I use my water bottle because I was curious to find out just how much water I could drink before becoming desperate. Throughout this entire ordeal, I started feeling aroused and somewhat excited. Since last time that this had happened, I couldn&#8217;t think about anything except about my bladder, so I made sure to try and preoccupy myself from obsessing over my bladder by doing my regular routines, like email, phoning, watching some news, etc.<br />
Before I had started feeling really desperate, I made sure that I had put on a pair of diapers to make it more convenient for me later, because I didn&#8217;t want to try risking it by putting them on with a full bladder and in a desperate state. Also, I made sure that I closed the curtains in my apartment because I was afraid some random guy or whoever may be watching me. During this entire time, I kept checking the time more often then I normally would because I was getting too excited and couldn&#8217;t stop myself from checking it. If I remember correctly, I kept checking it at least once every 5 minutes.<br />
Roughly 3 hours had passed since I had started doing it, and I could already start feeling the pressure in my bladder, but I wasn&#8217;t desperate yet. Unfortunately, by this time, I had already done all of my normal routines, and I wasn&#8217;t sure what I could do to kill some more time and keep my mind occupied. I decided to just watch some TV while waiting for what my bladder to do what it does best. After flicking through some channels on TV, I had finally found a movie that I loved to watch, and luckily, it was a long movie and it was still in the very beginning so there was still at least a couple hours left before it ended. <br />
While watching the movie, I kept absentmindedly drinking my cup of water. During commercial breaks, I kept going back to the kitchen to refill my bottle because I kept running out. Eventually, without noticing, I had drunk over 2.5 litres of water by the time that the movie was over. Add that to the other 1.5 litres of water that I had drank. <br />
After the movie had finished, I noticed that it had been a little over 5 hours since I started, and by that point, I had to pee quite desperately. Even though I really had to pee badly, it still wasn&#8217;t enough to make me want to do the pee pee dance&#8230;. if you know what I mean. I decided to continue trying to keep my mind off my bladder by going to check my email and calling my friends again. After a whole hour had passed, I had to go so badly that by that point, I was desperate enough to actually do the pee pee dance. Because of that, I knew I was close to losing control of my bladder.<br />
I went to lie on the couch and tried to watch some news or something. After some time had flew by, I had to pee so badly that I knew couldn&#8217;t hold it in much longer and no matter what I did, I couldn&#8217;t keep my mind off of it. A couple of minutes had passed, then all of the sudden, someone called me. I went to check the caller ID, and I noticed that it was my boyfriend who was calling me.<br />
&#8220;Darn&#8230; I don&#8217;t know exactly how much longer I can hold it in,&#8221; was the first thought that came into my head. Despite the fact that I already knew that I would lose control of my bladder quite soon, I decided to pick up the phone and start talking to him, but also try to keep the conversation as brief as possible.<br />
&#8220;Hello?&#8221;, I said. &#8220;Good afternoon, sweetheart!!&#8221; He said with a sweet voice.<br />
&#8220;Want to have lunch together later today??&#8221; He asked.<br />
With the full bladder on my mind, I tried to answer as clearly as I possibly could under the circumstances. &#8220;Surrrre honey, <span class="caps">IIII</span>&#8230;. can have lunch with you!! What&#8230; time?&#8221;<br />
Unfortunately, he noticed me stuttering a little, so he asked me if anything was wrong!<br />
I told him nothing was wrong, but he really thought I had a problem or something. I kinda laughed a tiny bit because he doesn&#8217;t know that he&#8217;s actually talking me into losing control of my bladder into the diaper. But I also thought that he was sweet to have been so concerned about me.<br />
I assured him once again that there wasn&#8217;t anything wrong, so he dropped the subject. Anyway, he suggested 3:30pm. I looked at the time and realized it was only an hour from then. I decided that it would be a good time to meet up. We both agreed to eat lunch at that time and after saying our usual romantic goodbyes we then hung up.<br />
Since I had to meet him in an hour, I decided to kneel down right there by the phone and slowly release a jet of pee. I intended to only let a few seconds of pee out, but inevitably, I couldn&#8217;t control just how much I could pee out at once because I was too desperate, and so I just started peeing uncontrollably. <br />
I didn&#8217;t care though because it felt soooo good peeing like that. The stream of pee literally lasted over a minute before I was completely emptied. And I enjoyed every moment of it all up to the point that the last drop of pee I had in me came out. I felt so relieved that I started masturbating a bit. Then I quickly examined the diaper after a moment and noticed that the diaper was so full that if I had to pee any more, it could&#8217;ve start to leak out. I just quickly went to throw the wet diaper in the garbage can and take a long shower to get rid of the smell of my urine. Then I hopped into some clean clothes and went to have some lunch with my loving boyfriend.<br />
On my way there, I decided not to tell him about my new pleasure for now, considering that I wasn&#8217;t sure how he would take it, even though I thought it was kind of funny that he was talking to me on the phone just a moment before when I was in my full bladder state!!!! Overall, this was a very great experience for me!!!<br />
