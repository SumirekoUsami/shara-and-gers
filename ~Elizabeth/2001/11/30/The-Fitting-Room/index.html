                <p>Hi, My name is Elizabeth and I&#8217;m from England, I love this web site and visit frequently to read the latest stories and look at the pictures. I am not gay but get turned on by female desperation; anyway I had to tell someone what happened to me today&#8230;.<br />
I love playing holding games and getting myself into desperate situations in public, I always wait until I&#8217;m in the privacy of my own home before letting go though, perhaps in tight trousers or jeans or with nothing on in the bath or shower. Well today was a bit different, I was out shopping with a long skirt on and a sweater, just casual I suppose; and I was really feeling full, I&#8217;d had plenty to drink and couldn&#8217;t remember the last time i had been to the toilet. I wanted to wait as long as I could as the shops were closing soon and I didn&#8217;t have much time left&#8230;to be honest I thought I could hold it. I was in a shop called &#8216;<span class="caps">NEXT</span>.&#8217; For you nonâ€“locals it is a slightly up market ladies wear shop and this particular store was new, opening only this week. It was really big and I was quite involved picking out nice things for Christmas, anyway I didn&#8217;t realize it but i was sort of doing a little wiggle as i was walking round the shop with all my bags and clothes to try on and when I finally got to the front of the queue for the changing rooms I was in a bit of a state. My stomach was actually hurting; I don&#8217;t think i had ever let it get this far before&#8230;. anyway I went into the changing cubicle but found it really difficult to get changed and when I bent down to take my shoes off I was scared to stand up in case I went right there. I regained my composure but then in a bit of a panic I realized there was no way I could wait perhaps ten minutes to pay and make it back to my car or anywhere I could go and then it happened, my body just seemed to push some of my pee out. I couldn&#8217;t stop it happening but as soon as it did I pushed my hand between my legs and managed to get control. I could feel it coming back and I knew I was going to pee myself so I crouched down in the corner of the cubicle and tried to pull my knickers aside but it was too late&#8230;. my pee shot out so fast and noisily, I know whoever was in the cubicle next to me could hear. It was flooding through my knickers and on to the carpet floor. I managed to stop before too much had come out and I quickly got out of there leaving my purchases for another time. I got to the car really fast and took my knickers off in the car park leaving them on the floor and got in the car. I had some tissues and cleaned myself up a bit but I was still dying to pee. I thought I was going to wet the car seat all the way home and nearly did but as I arrived home I got out of the car by my house I just let go, it felt so good, there were people on the other side of the road but I was beyond caring and I continued to piss myself right up to my front door, leaving a huge trail on my path&#8230;. and through the house. When I finally got into the bath I was thinking about the whole situation and couldn&#8217;t help but bring myself to orgasm, a wet one at that&#8230;<br />
