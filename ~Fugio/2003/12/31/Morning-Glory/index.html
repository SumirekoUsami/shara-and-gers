                <p>Glory tossed and turned in the bed of her college dorm room. Trying to remain asleep was difficult when the noon sun shone harshly through her window, creating a beam formed by the dust in the air that glared directly into her eyes. It also didn&#8217;t help that she had to pee so bad, but at the moment she was still too lazy to get up. It didn&#8217;t take long before she couldn&#8217;t stand it anymore, and she slowly, reluctantly, threw herself out of her sheets and clumsily stood on the soft rug. Orientating herself, she grew more aware of her urge.<br />
&#8220;Man, I gotta pee&#8230;&#8221; she mumbled to herself as she stepped into a pair of pink fuzzy slippers.<br />
She had to squeeze her legs together as she pulled her long red hair back into a ponytail with both hands. After a quick check in the mirror she left the room. Taking quick strides along the cold, hard floor of the hallway, Glory entered the unclean bathroom and took to the nearest stall. She ritualistically wiped down the seat with toilet paper, which seemed to take longer than usual because she really had to pee now. She turned around, rear end facing the toilet, and with both hands pushed the thin fabric of her pajama bottoms down past her wide hips, letting them fall at her ankles.<br />
Realizing how much she had to pee, a playful thought entered her mind: she would slowly pull down her panties and continue to stand there for as long as possible, something she had often done as a child. And when she could no longer hold in the pee, she would slowly sit down and let loose. With both hands she lowered her panties inch by inch down to her knees. She stood there now, the pale fleshy cheeks of her buttocks exposed and feeling the cold air (an ex–boyfriend once commented that she had the whitest black–ass of any girl he ever knew), and feeling the fullness of her bladder, feeling all that pee crowding towards her pee–hole trying to escape. It felt like a swimming pool trying to get out of there. Refusing to use her hands to hold it in, Glory squirmed her legs to and fro, her pale white buttocks jiggling in response. After a few more minutes she felt like she was going to explode, so she melodramatically took steps backwards toward the toilet.<br />
She was just about to sit down when a piercing din broke the silence– the fire alarm! Glory was so startled she nearly peed herself, but then she realized that she would have to leave the building, so she pulled her panties and pajama bottoms back up and left the bathroom in a hurry. Descending the stairs with a crowd of sleepy college kids, her breasts bounced up and down through the light blue t–shirt she wore. It was one of the only pieces of clothing she owned that actually showed the true fullness of her breasts; she didn&#8217;t like people to see how big they were. Stepping out into the chilly morning air with hundreds of other students, she folded her arms in an effort to disguise the nipple erection she was getting. Not forgetting how bad she had to pee, she crossed her legs and squirmed around in the crowd, pretending to gather warmth. Among the dozens of conversations now taking place, she overheard one girl say, &#8220;It rang right when I was peeing! I had to pinch it off in midstream and pull my pants back up, and I still have to pee!&#8221; That only made Glory have to pee even more.<br />
After a few minutes, but what seemed like an hour, the students were let back in the door. A prankster had pulled the fire alarm, of course. Glory made a mental note to find the kid and kick his ass. As she ran back into the bathroom, she was horrified to find a line of girls waiting to use the two stalls (one of them was out of order). She waited in desperation, contemplating for the first time that she might not be able to hold it in time. It felt like all that pee was right outside her pee hole, she felt like it was going to squirt out at any moment. Refusing to hold her crotch once again, she made tight fists at her sides and squeezed her thighs together as hard as she could, biting her lip and moving her legs around in tight circular motions. There was only one girl in front of her now. As a stall opened, the girl raced inside, saying &#8220;Now to finish what I&#8217;ve started!&#8221; Glory realized that it was the girl who had to stop peeing when the fire alarm rang. She heard the girl gasp and then the loud sound of pee jetting into the toilet bowl. It echoed throughout the bathroom as the girl moaned in relief &#8220;Oh! Oh God! That feels so good, oh!&#8221; Glory couldn&#8217;t take it anymore, she knew her pee was about to come out in the next moment, so she looked frantically around the bathroom and noticed the sink. It was gonna come out either way, so she quickly pulled down her pajama bottoms and panties and backed up on the cold porcelain sink just as a stream of clear hot pee burst from her lips. It came out so fast and so hard that it splashed back on her ass and her thighs, as well as onto the mirror. She had to stifle the moan as the hot pee rushed out of her loins in a fury. After a full minute, she was still pissing like a horse and after the next minute it seemed she was peeing even harder and faster than she was when she started. She thought to herself if it kept up much longer she&#8217;d have an orgasm. By the third minute she did. After four minutes of pissing like a waterfall she was still going strong, and she began to wonder if it would ever stop.<br />
