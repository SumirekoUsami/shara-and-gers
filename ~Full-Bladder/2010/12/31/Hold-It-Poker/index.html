                <p>Note: This story contains Female Desperation, Accidental &amp; Deliberate Wetting, Humiliation, and Bondage.<br />
Mandy had an unusual relationship with her boss and lover, Doug. Outside of work, he was everything she could ask for in a man; he was kind, passionate, and extremely fun to be with. However, the situation was a little different at work. He had requested that their relationship should be kept a secret for now, because it looked unprofessional and he was fearful of getting of being perceived as someone who took advantage of women who worked for him. He asked her to continue to address him as Mr. Welsh at work and not to show any public displays of affection at the office. He promised her that he would tell his colleagues and clients about their relationship when the time was appropriate. That didn&#8217;t stop Mandy from flashing her boss every now and then. She still put on desperation shows for him on days when things were slow. Every once in while, he would follow her into the toilets to watch her pee.<br />
Mandy had tried to get him more involved in the fun, but it was hard with the new firm getting busier every week. She had purchased a pair of vibrating panties and had given Doug the remote control. Sometimes, she would feel her libido getting stimulated as she sat at her desk. She would turn around to see her boss smiling at her knowing what was going on inside her panties. Doug would usually turn it off when she signalled or told him to, so that she wouldn&#8217;t have to scream out her lungs at her desk. However he did tend to get a little more naughty at times, such as when she was desperate in the middle of a lengthy phone call.<br />
The most memorable example of this was on Thursday when she was talking to a man who didn&#8217;t speak English too well and was difficult to understand. Mandy was desperate to the point where she was standing up from her chair and dancing at her desk. Doug had not been too busy that afternoon and had gotten out his toy for some entertainment. He had started off with slow massage setting on the remote control, which Mandy had found quite relaxing. However as the phone call dragged on, Doug steadily increased the intensity, making her more and more uncomfortable. She would have enjoyed the growing erotic sensation between her legs if not for the fact that she had to refrain herself from screaming into the phone and wetting her pants. Her sentences came out in moans and her bladder pulsed wanting nothing more than to release its liquid into her tight jeans. She had hung on desperately for almost five minutes, her legs scissoring violently and her hand on her crotch. She couldn&#8217;t decide if she should push down to put pressure on her pee hole or try to pull her vibrating panties away from her vulva. It was extremely difficult to do either through the thick denim cloth. Finally Mandy had reached the point where orgasm was inevitable. Her entire body shook as she tried to stifle her cries of pleasure. Her hips were rocking back and forth as she sunk her teeth into her lower lip trying to hold off the climax for just a little while longer. Doug watched eagerly, wondering if she would be able to survive this onslaught until the end of the phone call.<br />
Mandy felt her pelvic muscles contract forcefully and knew she was close to the magical moment when she would undoubtedly lose all control. She was certain she had already squirted in her panties, but a little pee would not stop the vibrator– she already knew this from experience. She desperately told the man on the phone to hang on a minute, barely able to gasp out the words. She placed the phone on her desk and darted off the washroom, trying to undo her jeans before she peed in them. She never made it to the toilet seat. The orgasm that she had evaded for so long hit just as she entered the washroom. Her knees buckled and she just barely grasped the vanity counter to avoid falling heavily onto the tiled floor. She screamed in ecstasy as the orgasmic waves overcame her and she finally lost control of her bladder. She collapsed to her hands and knees as she completely soaked her jeans, unable to stop urinating until she was completely empty and in the middle of a massive puddle.<br />
As she rose back to her feet she felt the vibrations come to an abrupt stop. She turned around, already knowing she would see Doug standing behind her. Her jeans were drenched from her crotch down to her feet. She wondered what she would do now with the results of her accident clearly visible to any client visiting the office.<br />
She tried to step around Doug to get back her desk to finish up her conversation on the phone. However, he had other plans. He gently put his arms around her as she approached him and gave her a long kiss. He handed her a bulky package covered in wrapping paper with a cupid design. He told her he would deal with the client on the phone while she opened her present.<br />
Mandy had ripped open the package to reveal a beautiful purple knee length skirt. There was also a plastic bag for her wet jeans and panties. Finally, there was an invitation card to a lawyers&#8217; union dinner on Saturday night. Doug had signed, &#8220;It&#8217;s time to show off my treasure. Love, Doug.&#8221; That had left Mandy smiling as she changed and headed back to her desk.<br />
Now the big day was finally here. Mandy was dressed stunningly in a classic red dress and white heels. Her eyes sparkled to match her expensive diamond earrings. She had paid a visit to the salon to get her hair done. She wanted to look perfect for Doug. Underneath her dress, she wore only her vibrating panties, freshly washed and fully charged. She had debated about wearing them, but had decided she would don them to please Doug if he wanted to get a little naughty after the dinner.<br />
Mandy heard her doorbell ring. Doug was there to pick her up. She took one final look in the mirror to make sure her lipstick didn&#8217;t require any touching up and went to get the door.<br />
Doug looked at the beautiful woman in front of him– her full red lips, sky blue eyes, perfect body. He longed to drag her back into her house and fuck her brains out on her own bed. However, he knew this was an important dinner, which had to be attended especially when he had such a prize to introduce to the world. He couldn&#8217;t wait to see the looks on his college mates faces when he introduced her to them.<br />
Doug told Mandy she looked incredible, leaving her blushing on the walk to the car. She was feeling excited about tonight. After this dinner, everyone would know that she was Doug&#8217;s girlfriend. She would be able to tell all of her friends about the relationship without feeling like a secretary with benefits. She couldn&#8217;t resist giving her man a kiss as he opened the passenger side door for her, even though it could ruin her makeup. It was a good thing that she had remembered to put the lipstick in her purse so that she would be able to touch up in the car. Their eyes met as Doug started up the <span class="caps">BMW</span> and Mandy gave him a warm smile.<br />
It was a twenty–minute drive to the banquet hall where the dinner was taking place and Mandy was surprised at how many cars were in the parking lot. She had no idea so many lawyers would be attending. There were license plates from Oregon, Idaho, British Columbia, even California. She was starting to feel a little nervous; she didn&#8217;t want to let Doug down. Doug seemed to sense her discomfort and smiled at her reassuringly. He told her not to worry and just act natural. She was a smart beautiful girl and she would be just fine. Mandy felt a little more confident as the two walked in holding hands.<br />
It took Doug about five minutes to locate two of his friends in the heavily crowded hall. There were introductions all around before the three men engaged in their own conversation reminiscing about old times, leaving the three women to themselves. One of the other ladies was recently engaged while the other one was dating. They exchanged stories for a while before deciding to visit the toilets quickly before the dinner started. Mandy felt a very slight need to pee but figured that emptying her bladder before sitting down for a few hours was a good idea.<br />
The conversation started up again in front of the basins in the ladies room. The woman that was engaged, Julie, had attended the dinner last year and had found it quite unusual. Just before dinner was served, they had announced a &#8220;hold it&#8221; contest for the ladies, where the contestants were eligible to win a diamond necklace worth $2,000, along with a cash prize of $1,000. This was an incredible compensation for holding in your pee for a few hours, but there still weren&#8217;t many women brave enough to risk peeing themselves in front of hundreds of people. Julie said that her fiancT had encouraged her to participate but she just hadn&#8217;t been able to muster up the courage to do it. She had promised him that she would try to win this year, but she was really regretting those words now.<br />
The announcement telling the guests to find themselves a seat came just as Julie, Mandy, and Krista were exiting the washroom. Julie had timed the washroom break perfectly. The ladies found their dates and sat down, nervously anticipating what was coming next. The speaker at the front informed the group that dinner would be served in a few minutes and everyone should get started on the water and red wine until then.<br />
Mandy had not decided if she was going to participate in the contest yet, so she accepted only a half glass of wine when Doug offered. She noticed that Julie had refused to drink anything at all while Krista poured herself a full glass of water. Mandy sipped slowly wondering if Doug would ask her to participate. He had not mentioned anything at all about this contest, which was a little weird considering the things that happened regularly at the office.<br />
Ten minutes passed by without any dinner or announcements. Mandy was starting to wonder what exactly was going to happen tonight. She suspected that Julie had been joking around with her to try and get a cheap laugh of the whole deal. She was probably eagerly waiting for the moment where something was mentioned about a pee holding contest so she could laugh her head off with everyone else at the table. Krista was probably in on the prank as well. Why else would she down a full glass of water without a second thought? Maybe she had already decided that she would not risk peeing herself in front of so many people, no matter what the prize. Or perhaps she was just a poor actress compared to Julie. Julie looked like she had just seen a ghost and sat absolutely still with her hands clenched together on the table.<br />
Finally, the speaker returned to the podium to address the audience again. &#8220;It appears as if our chefs are a little behind schedule tonight, so why don&#8217;t we play a fun game in the meantime?&#8221;<br />
The majority of the audience immediately cheered in agreement, knowing the delay was part of the set–up for the night&#8217;s festivities. Mandy felt butterflies in her stomach and dared not make eye contact with Doug, who was gently massaging her right hand.<br />
The host continued. &#8220;I am going to need some brave ladies to come up here tonight to play a game we like to call &#8220;hold–it poker&#8221;! The rules are pretty straight forward, but it is not an easy game to play, I promise you. The contestants will not be allowed to leave the stage under any conditions until the contest is officially declared over. Each of the participants will be required to drink two glasses of water before the game begins. After that, the ladies will draw one card from a fair deck every fifteen minutes. The ladies holding cards with values less than six will drink one full glass of wine. Ladies holding values between six and ten will drink one full glass of water. Any royal cardholders will drink a half–glass of water. Any lady holding an ace will be exempt from liquid consumption. The process of determining the winner is quite simple– she who keeps her panties dry wins!&#8221;<br />
The men in the audience applauded loudly as the speaker paused for effect. Mandy looked across at Julie and saw her squirm uncomfortably in her seat. She looked pleadingly at her fiancT who returned her gaze with a firm stare. Mandy snuck a peek at her own man, who gave her an encouraging smile.<br />
&#8220;Now the moment you have all been waiting for! I present to you our most expensive winning prize ever!&#8221; The speaker turned on a large screen behind him to reveal a pair of Tahitian Pearl gold earrings lined with diamonds. &#8220;These earrings are worth an incredible $3,000! The winner will also receive $1,000 cash, which means one lucky lady will be $4,000 richer at the end of the night! Now, will our first brave lady please stand up and bring her glass to the front?&#8221;<br />
There was another roar from the audience followed up by excited chatter. Several men were urging their dates to go up and try their luck. It was a tough decision for the women. The prize was absolutely stunning, but there was a higher chance of suffering the embarrassment of wetting yourself and walking off the stage with nothing. At Mandy&#8217;s own table, Julie&#8217;s fiancT was urging her to keep her promise and enter the contest. Mandy felt sorry for her, but did not say anything, not wishing to upset Doug.<br />
The nervous chatter continued for about a minute before a slim spectacled blonde woman in her late thirties or early forties stood up with her glass in hand and walked to the stage. The entire room suddenly fell quiet and the only sound was her heels clacking as she walked. It was a surprising sight to see a woman of her age willing to participate in such a contest. She wore a nametag, which identified her as a lawyer and not just a guest at the dinner. She was smartly dressed in a white collared shirt and dress pants. Even the smooth talking host was speechless for a moment as she approached him.<br />
&#8220;Well– this is a pleasant surprise folks. Our first contestant of the night is a beautiful lady named Angela Shrewt. Let&#8217;s give her a nice round of applause folks– she is actually a very successful lawyer like many of you here!&#8221;<br />
The speaker instructed her to stand to the right of him and asked for another contestant. It didn&#8217;t take as long this time as two giggling mid–twenties women, Teri, a redhead, and Amy, a blonde walked to the stage together finishing up the wine in their glasses. They were clearly quite intoxicated already and had probably been drinking before arriving at the dinner. Mandy knew that there was little chance of either of them surviving for long with a considerate amount of alcohol already in their systems. Unless the blonde had a bladder control problem and no one else entered, they would not win the contest.<br />
The next contestant was a tall busty brunette knockout named Diane, who ran to the front of the hall immediately after the two drunken women. She couldn&#8217;t have been over the age of 21, but already sported a large diamond ring. Her skimpy white dress showed off her sexy young body. She happily bounced next to Teri and waved back at her husband with a confident smile. Julie&#8217;s fiancT was whispering fiercely at her now. It looked like he was starting to get angry. Julie looked like she was going to cry.<br />
A petite oriental lady named Cho got up next and walked to the front nervously, almost stumbling on her way to the stage. She was pretty with short black hair stood five feet tall in a dark green blouse and black skirt. Mandy doubted that she could hold much liquid, but then again she might get lucky with some favourable cards.<br />
Mandy was starting to wonder if she should join the ladies on the stage. What would Doug think of her? Should she ask him? She glanced at him questioningly. He smiled back at her and shrugged his shoulders. Did he want her to participate or not? The last thing Mandy wanted to do was put herself in such a vulnerable position in front of so many people if Doug would hate her for it. It was such a grand prize! She wanted to win it for him.<br />
A few minutes passed without any more women getting up. Julie&#8217;s fiancT had taken hold of her arm now and was furiously talking to her, attracting attention from nearby tables. Mandy and Krista looked at each other uncomfortably. Finally, Doug spoke up. &#8220;Please stop, Brad. It&#8217;s clear she is uncomfortable about doing this.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Then she shouldn&#8217;t have promised me this on the night I proposed to her.&#8221; Julie let out a shocked gasp and then buried her face in her hands crying.<br />
Mandy had enough. It was time for action. She gave Brad a dirty look and got up from her chair with her glass. She grabbed Julie by the arm and dragged her to her feet. She was going to have to do this with Julie or idiot Brad would ruin the whole night for her and Doug. She instructed Julie to pick up her own glass and they walked to the stage together.<br />
Julie managed to get herself somewhat under control as she walked to the stage, but still looked like a deer in headlights standing in front of the audience. Mandy felt excited and nervous at the same time. She had a great opportunity in front of her but it was not an easy task. Looking back at all the eyes focussed on her, she could not imagine touching her pussy in front of them. But to win the prize, it was almost certain that she would have to do that and more. She would have to push her body to its limits and it might not be enough to avoid peeing herself right there on the stage before all the other women did.<br />
Two more women ended up entering the contest before the host declared that registration was over. One of them was a tall athletic African–American woman in her mid–twenties named Yves. She was dressed in a bright colourful dress. The other last minute entrant was the Sylvia, a short, busty blonde woman in her late twenties wearing a low cut blouse and thin white dress pants. She was the second lawyer to enter the contest.<br />
Mandy grew excited as she watched Sylvia walk by her. If her pants got wet, they would surely become transparent. Mandy wondered if she realised that everyone would get to see what she was wearing underneath her pants. What if she wasn&#8217;t even wearing underwear?<br />
Her thoughts were interrupted by the host&#8217;s voice. &#8220;Now before we bring the dinner out, these ladies are going to be inspected to make sure they are not cheating– no maxi pads or diapers.&#8221; He paused to let the audience laugh at the joke before continuing. &#8220;Then they will drink their two glasses of water before they are cuffed to ensure they don&#8217;t leave the stage until the contest is over. Enjoy the dinner and enjoy the show, everyone.&#8221;<br />
A tall brunette dressed in a police officer uniform came out from the crowd onto the stage. She reminded Mandy of the cop who had pulled her over a few months ago. She felt around the women&#8217;s crotch areas to make sure they were wearing only panties. She even reached under the waistbands of the two women wearing pants to ensure they weren&#8217;t hiding anything, drawing applause from the audience. Mandy blushed deeply as she felt the policewoman feel up the small vibrating device embedded in her panties and give her a subtle smile as she moved on to inspect Julie. After the panty inspections, the cop instructed all the women to hold out their glasses with their right hands and filled all of them with a large pitcher of water. They were given two minutes to down the water before the glasses were refilled.<br />
After they had all drank two glasses of water, the policewoman chained the women together. There was enough room to move around– about three feet worth, but there was no way to leave the stage unless they all moved together. Plastic chairs were brought onto the stage by waiters and placed behind each of the contestants. There was also a large oval barrier made of absorbable material placed around the nine women and chairs, presumably to prevent their urine from flowing all over stage. There would undoubtedly be a lot of liquid being released onto the stage floor tonight.<br />
The audience didn&#8217;t pay too much attention to the women at first. After all, there was a hot dinner that needed to be eaten and the show would only get better with time. Even still, the beautiful women on the stage deserved attention and every eye in the room scanned them carefully between bites for any signs of desperation– perhaps a small shuffle of feet, clench of hands, or biting of lips.<br />
About ten minutes into dinner, it was time for the ladies to draw cards. &#8220;Let&#8217;s shuffle up and deeeeeal!&#8221; the host shouted into the microphone which caused most of the audience members to drop their forks and knives to divert their attention onto the stage. The policewoman shuffled the deck smartly and offered the women any card of their choice as she marched from one end of the line to the other.<br />
Diane, Yves, and Sylvia ended up the worse off from the first exchange, having to drink full glasses of wine. Mandy knew that alcohol was a diuretic and that it would make the women want the toilet soon. She regretted drinking the half glass at her table. It would make her bladder fill more quickly compared to water. Mandy ended up having to drink a full glass of water with Teri, Angela, Cho and Julie. Amy ended up being the lucky one, as she only had to drink a half glass of water.<br />
None of the women were showing any signs of discomfort yet, but Amy and Teri had stopped giggling and cracking jokes. They were much quieter now and no longer smiling. Mandy suspected that they were just now coming to realization of what would eventually happen to them. She let herself smile a little. It would be fun to watch them over the next hour or so when they would probably have to pee in their clothes. Judging from their tipsiness, there was enough alcohol in their bodies to fill up a large portion of their bladders. They had no chance of winning at all; they would be wise to wet themselves now rather than later on in greater discomfort.<br />
Before Mandy knew it, another fifteen minutes had passed and it was time to confront Lady Luck again. This time she got a Jack, which meant only a half glass of water. Mandy was grateful that she had been pretty lucky so far. Only Amy had been luckier, drawing the Ace of Spades this round, meaning she had only drunk a half–glass of water thus far. However, Mandy knew it hardly mattered considering the disadvantage she and Teri had. Teri had just been forced to down a full glass of wine, which did not help her desperation or drunkenness.<br />
By the next card drawing, Teri was showing signs of desperation. The audience could see that she that she was in trouble– her inability to remain seated in her chair, constant movement, even the perspiration on her face. Everyone was hoping that a glass of wine was in the cards for Teri, but it turned out to be a glass of water instead. She had now downed four glasses of water and a glass of wine. Her desperation was increasing quickly as her kidneys worked quickly to dispose of the excess fluids from her body.<br />
She looked over at her friend Amy who also appeared to be in some discomfort as well though not as bad as her. They had been drinking at home and already had three cocktails in them before they arrived at the dinner. Another glass of wine each and the hold it contest had seemed like a great idea. Now here she was, destined to wet her panties in front of the world and not able to do a darned thing about it. She crossed her legs and pushed them together as hard as she could. She hated being seen like this, but she had no choice. She couldn&#8217;t believe her luck. If only the darn cards hadn&#8217;t made her drink so much. Maybe if Amy got another glass of wine in the next draw, she would be able to avoid being the first girl to wet herself.<br />
The entire room silenced again as the time had come for the women to draw cards again. The dinner plates had been removed from the tables and desserts were being served. Everyone knew that the two drunken women would not last long now. The audience watched eagerly as Teri drew her card and groaned in disappointment when she flipped it over to reveal an ace. However, Amy was not as lucky as she got her second straight glass of wine.<br />
Teri had her hands in her crotch now as she tried to hold on at least until the next drawing. She had not wanted to hold herself in front of everyone but now she had no choice if she wanted to stay dry. She looked at Amy chained next to her and saw her awkwardly standing with her legs crossed with her hands clenching the sides of her dress. Teri knew that she was resisting the urge of pushing up on her pee hole with her fingers, even though she would inevitably have to do it soon enough.<br />
Mandy was starting to feel a growing need to pee but wasn&#8217;t in any real danger yet. She could see that all of the ladies were starting to look worried. She doubted Teri would make it long past the next round no matter what card she drew. Amy would probably wet herself soon after. Sylvia was also showing minor signs of desperation.<br />
Teri bounced up and down helplessly as the policewoman approached her again holding out the deck of cards evenly spread out. She removed one of her hands from her crotch and selected one. She flipped it over praying for another ace. It was a six of clubs, which meant one full glass of water. She aspirated deeply. She was doomed.<br />
Beside her, Amy flipped over her own card, also a six. She was also holding herself now. Her goal was to last until Teri began to wet herself. Then, when everyone&#8217;s eyes were on Teri, she would quickly take care of her own needs without too much attention. She felt bad about using her friend like this, but knew that it was her only chance of relief without everyone in the whole building witnessing a very embarrassing accident. God, she was desperate. Why wouldn&#8217;t Teri just piss herself already? She had done it plenty of times when they went out clubbing together. Amy picked up her glass and held it out so that the police officer could fill it up. Teri had already started sipping beside her.<br />
As Teri finished drinking and bent over to replace her glass on the floor, she felt a squirt escape her. She quickly straightened up with a short but very audible gasp and pressed hard on her womanhood. She saw the audience collectively lean forward in their seats and focus their undivided attention on her, anticipating the first wetting of the night. She wriggled around helplessly, trying to stop squirting. Finally, after five minutes the dam completely burst. She felt the warmth fill her panties and then run down her legs to her feet. She stopped moving and stood absolutely still as her bladder completely emptied itself into her underwear. She stood in silent humiliation, staring back at all the eyes locked on her.<br />
Amy watched eagerly as Teri finally started to lose complete control of her bladder. She took a quick glance at the crowd to ensure that everyone was focussed on her friend. She slowly stepped as far away from Teri as the chains would allow her to and relaxed her strained vaginal muscles. She couldn&#8217;t help shuddering happily with relief as her long held waters were finally permitted to flow out of her and onto the stage. She spread open her legs in an attempt to avoid wetting them, but her pee still managed to spiral down her legs making them glisten in the bright stage lights. There was no hiding her accident. Midway through her accident, she realised that her friend had finished peeing herself a while ago and the audience had shifted its attention to her. She sat down in her chair and covered her face in shame, still peeing.<br />
At the other end of the line, Sylvia had gotten up from her chair and was pacing around desperately. She had been the unluckiest one on the stage and she was already bursting from three glasses of water and three glasses of wine. She couldn&#8217;t believe how she, an attractive, smart lawyer, had gotten herself into such trouble. Her greed had gotten the best of her yet again. The moment she had laid eyes on the beautiful earrings she had to have them at all costs. She had spent the better part of fifteen minutes arguing with her husband about entering the contest but at last he had given up and let her go. Now here she was, needing the toilet worse than ever before in her life. She wished she had not been so blinded by the sparkling earrings on the screen and had thought this out logically. She couldn&#8217;t wet her pants in front all her friends and colleagues– she just couldn&#8217;t. It was one thing for young drunk girls to come on stage and piss themselves, but a whole other ordeal for a well–known lawyer like her. This story was bound to get around and her reputation would be smashed. What had she been thinking?<br />
As the policewoman neared her with the deck of cards for the next round of &#8220;poker&#8221;, Sylvia whispered an urgent plea to her. &#8220;I really need to get off this stage. Please uncuff me now.&#8221;<br />
The beautiful brunette only smiled in response and offered her the cards again forcing her to take a card. It was a three, meaning another glass of wine.<br />
&#8220;Please Ma&#8217;am!&#8221; she begged as the lady poured wine into her glass, &#8220;I&#8217;m really, really desperate! I&#8217;ll do anything!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;No, I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t let you leave the stage even if you are about to pee yourself, Miss,&#8221; the officer replied, loudly enough for everyone in the audience to hear. There was loud applause and laughter.<br />
Sylvia was in tears now, begging softly. &#8220;Please, I&#8217;ll give you money. How about $500 or $1000? Just tell me what you want!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;You better shut it and drink up, Miss! You don&#8217;t want me to have to discipline you!&#8221; she responded waving a baton from her belt, drawing another roar from the crowd.<br />
Sylvia lifted up the glass to her lips to sip from it, her legs closed tightly as she bounced up and down. She imagined losing control in front of everyone soaking her tight white pants. It would be so awkward facing her colleagues again after they had seen her wet her pants like a little girl. In horror, she suddenly remembered that she was wearing white cotton panties, so that her underwear wouldn&#8217;t show through the thin cloth of her pants. If she wet herself, her pants and her panties would become transparent. The audience members would be able to see <span class="caps">EVERYTHING</span>.<br />
She desperately gestured to the policewoman to get her attention. &#8220;I need to get off this stage, <span class="caps">PLEASE</span>! If I pee myself everyone is going to see&#8230;&#8221; She gestured to her crotch with her hands.<br />
The policewoman nodded understandingly. She seemed more sympathetic to her situation, but still didn&#8217;t budge. &#8220;I&#8217;m terribly sorry Miss, but I am not in charge of the competition here. You have to follow the rules. It is only fair to everyone else playing.&#8221;<br />
Sylvia couldn&#8217;t believe the dilemma she was in. She felt her bladder contract and grabbed her crotch in reflex before realizing what she was doing in front of hundreds of people. She removed hand and crossed her legs again. She located her hubby still seated at their table. He was seated with his arms crossed with a smug look on his face. He seemed to be enjoying the fact that she was learning an important lesson. Ah! If only she had just listened to him!<br />
Before she knew it, it was time to drink again, this time a half glass of water for her. She could not resist grabbing her crotch as the drinks were poured into glasses. She gulped the water down as quickly as possible. Drinking almost made her lose control. She was close to leaking in her pants and she knew it.<br />
Mandy scanned the competition to the left and right of her. None of the remaining contestants were seated anymore. They were all hunching over awkwardly, crossing their legs, pacing desperately. It would be a battle down to the wire. Her own bladder was really full; she could feel it pushing up against the waistband of her panties. Still, she sensed that she was in pretty good shape. Sylvia, Cho, and Yves were all explicitly holding themselves, while Julie had started to give her pussy a hard squeeze every now and then. She was trying to be discrete about it, bending over to move her glass or scratch her leg, but Mandy knew what she was doing.<br />
By the next round, Sylvia was wetting her pants, slowly but surely. She barely held the floodgates shut as she reached to draw a card. When she held out her glass, she lost control. She explosively peed into her pants, trying to cover her crotch from view with her one available hand. The wet fabric clung to her legs showing off her figure to hundreds of eager eyes. As she came to the realization that all the members of the lawyers union had just watched her pee her pants, she burst into tears. To make matters worse, she would have to remain on the stage in her soaked see–through pants until the contest ended.<br />
Mandy had gotten a good look at Sylvia&#8217;s butt before she had sat down. She could clearly see her naked cheeks through the tight pants and the panties underneath. As she turned back to face the audience again, she felt something vibrating against her vagina. She almost lost control of her bladder and quickly shoved her hands into her crotch. However, the vibrations had stopped as quickly as they had started. She looked at Doug in the crowd, who gave her a big smile and a quick wink. He had brought the remote control to the vibrating panties with him. Mandy looked at him pleadingly, trying to make him understand that he could not do that again or she would surely wet herself.<br />
Cho was next to lose control. Her squirming turned into a shiver as her exhausted urethra muscles finally gave out. She quickly lifted up her expensive dress to avoid wetting it and squatted down, giving the audience a clear view of her lacy red panties with a clear stream flowing out from the crotch. She wanted to make sure that her girlfriend saw the full show. She had entered the contest promising to win her lover the majestic prize. However, the real reason she had decided to participate was because of her pee fetish, something she had told her lover about yet. Cho had been amazed that such an opportunity had been presented to her on a silver platter and had decided to participate despite her nervousness. She hoped that her courage would pay off and this would open the door for wet fun with her partner in the future.<br />
All the remaining women were holding themselves as they drew cards again. The cards were really crucial now. The contest was so close that luck would likely determine who would win. Yves and Diane both drew aces this time, while Mandy and Angela got full glasses of water. Julie and Angela got wine. It seemed like the two most desperate women were Yves and Julie. Mandy doubted that they would last till their next drink.<br />
She was right. Julie flooded her panties a few minutes after she finished her wine. Her bladder was simply too full and tired to continue holding the constant stream flowing in from her kidneys. She fearfully glanced at her fiancT as her pee splattered down to the stage floor. He had a look of utter disgust on his face. Julie started bawling loudly as she finished peeing. Mandy hobbled over to her and tried to comfort her. She gently stroked her hair and helped her back to her chair, where she sat sobbing.<br />
Yves lost control of her own bladder before Julie had finished emptying hers. The feeling of the warm pee flowing down her legs was surprisingly pleasant. She pushed up against her vagina wetting her hand and the front of her dress. It sent a pleasurable tingling sensation from her vagina right down to the tips of her toes. She felt much better as she finished peeing and sat back down beside Sylvia and Julie.<br />
Yves was a fourth year law student at Seattle University. She had entered the contest to try to earn some cash to pay off some of her student debt. She had debated if it was a good idea to enter in something like this with so many lawyers in the audience. Some of them could easily end up being her employers or co–workers. In the end, she had decided to try her luck in the competition anyways. After all, the first entrant had been a lawyer and she could always move somewhere else to work once she finished her education. Unfortunately for her, she had not been able to hold on long enough.<br />
Now there were only three contestants remaining– Mandy, Angela, and Diane. Mandy had felt a few squirts escape into her panties already and could feel the wetness on her fingers. She doubted she could last much longer. Luckily, the other ladies looked extremely desperate as well. Diane was in the same position as her but no wetness was visible yet. Mandy thought she had seen some wetness in the crotch region of Angela&#8217;s black dress pants while she danced around with hands pinned between her legs, but she couldn&#8217;t tell for sure.<br />
Angela was a 38–year–old virgin. It was not because she was unattractive, but a result of her lifestyle. She had always been an overachiever and in control of every situation. She had graduated from high school two years early as the top student in her graduation class. She finished her law degree at Stanford University three years later. By age 24, she had already opened her own firm. Now she was a multi–millionaire with investments all over the world. However, she was notoriously incapable of socially interacting with anyone, always thinking and talking only business. She was widely known as a hard–ass lawyer that only the richest people could afford. She had no friends and visited her parents annually during the only break she granted herself– a weeklong holiday at the end of every December.<br />
She had gone to see a therapist after many years of begging from her mother. The therapist had encouraged her to focus more on her social life and less on work. She had stressed that it was all right not to be in complete control of everything all the time and she would be much more successful at personal relationships if she let herself go a little. She managed to convince Angela to try attending a social event. Obviously, she had no one to go with, but had promised her therapist that she would try to socialize with other lawyers there.<br />
Angela had tried to engage in the conversation at her table, but she just could not stand the stupid jokes and laughter. She had ended up challenging the other women at the table to go up to the stage to prove that they had balls, getting some awkward looks from everyone at the table. Angela had opted to get up and join the contest rather than listen to the chatter at the table all night. Besides, her therapist wanted her to get out of her comfort zone, so why not start here?<br />
Now she was on the verge of peeing in her pants. She had never imagined herself doing something like this. This was definitely an unusual feeling for her. She was never one to let herself get in any situation where she needed to pee this badly. She followed a strict routine where she peed every two hours during the day. She had followed the same diet for the past 20 years, which included six glasses of water per day. She had mastered fluid intake and expulsion so well that she had never been in any serious danger of peeing herself– until tonight.<br />
The host came back onto the podium to announce that the contest was down to the last three participants. He had some further explanations on how the winner would be determined from this moment on. &#8220;The rules are no different from what we have had until now. A wetting must clearly happen for the remaining ladies to be eliminated. Squirts are far too difficult to keep track of and besides, I&#8217;m pretty sure that all of the ladies here are a little wet already.&#8221; There was a cheer from the crowd.<br />
The host smiled and continued, &#8220;A contestant will be eliminated once she pees a significant amount on the floor. A few drops will be ignored but any puddle will result in elimination. Sheila here will be our judge.&#8221; He gestured to the policewoman who gave the crowd a big smile and a wave. Mandy wondered how she would be able to see any puddle at all. The entire floor area enclosed by the barriers was wet already.<br />
&#8220;Now, everyone get ready for our tenth round of &#8220;hold it poker&#8221; of the night! This could very well be the last one, folks!&#8221;<br />
Angela was the first to draw. She got a half glass of water. Diane was next, getting a full glass of water. Finally, Mandy drew a half glass of water as well. Mandy was hopelessly desperate at this point. She was using all the strength in every fibre of her body to hold her pee in. She was squirting frequently and could feel her hands getting completely soaked. She could feel her pee running down her legs as well. She glanced at Sheila who was alternating her gaze between the three women, ferociously scanning for any signs of an accident.<br />
Suddenly, she blew her whistle and pointed at Angela. She had finally lost control and was standing completely still, wetting her pants. Angela was surprised at how good it felt to give up control. She was glad she had experienced something new even if she hadn&#8217;t won. She had also noticed that a middle aged man wearing a classic brown hat seated at the far end of the hall had kept his eyes locked on her the entire time. Maybe trying things outside of her usual boundaries would pay off after all.<br />
Both Diane and Mandy were squirting heavily, but they somehow hung on for the next round. It had now been three hours since they had first downed two glasses of water. They both drew half glasses of water. Mandy knew that her vaginal muscles would completely give up soon. The pressure of so much fluid pushing down for so long was too much. Eventually the urine would force open her urethra and she would have no choice but to wet herself fully. She had never had to go to the washroom this bad. Usually she gave in to her desperation after the first few squirts, no matter what the situation. However, this time the stakes were far too high and she fought on valiantly. The squirts were coming faster and faster now. She would almost certainly completely wet herself in the next two minutes. But Mandy knew that the same thing was happening to Diane and she kept holding on.<br />
Mandy felt one long squirt, then another. She could feel Sheila&#8217;s eyes focussed on her crotch, but there was nothing she could do now. The battle was over. It didn&#8217;t matter how hard she tried to hold her pee in, it was going to come out. Her body completely gave up the fight against her bladder and an absolute flood escaped her pee hole. She pissed out gallons and gallons of urine. The relief was so intense that she hardly heard Sheila&#8217;s whistle, hardly noticed the applauding audience. She didn&#8217;t really care about anything at that moment, not even the beautiful earrings or the one thousand dollars. All she could think about what the exhilaration that filled her body as she finally let go.<br />
Diane heard the whistle blow a few seconds before she lost her own battle against her bladder. She threw her arms up in the air as she completely soaked her panties. She could see her husband rise up to his feet and applaud empathically. She had finally done it. Two years ago, her husband had brought her to the lawyers&#8217; union dinner as a third date. She was only 19 and up for anything after a few drinks, so she had entered for fun. She had wound up being the first one to wet herself, but had ended up engaging in an amazing night of sex with her date. That night, she had learned that he had loved what she had done on the stage. The next year, she had been a lot more experienced in the watersports department and had nearly won, wetting herself moments before the eventual winner did. Her husband had proposed to her that night. Now she was happily married to him and had a set of earrings to wear with her gorgeous wedding ring.<br />
After the cash and the earrings had been awarded, the girls were unchained and allowed to leave the stage. Teri and Amy walked back to their table, their boyfriends waiting to drive them home after a long night. Sylvia walked back to her husband, forgetting to cover her very visible camel toe in all the excitement. Cho ran into her excited lover&#8217;s arms, who had downed several glasses of wine after her dinner, which would surely leave her with a very full bladder by the time they arrived home. Julie got a warm hug from Brad, who was no longer angry at her. Yves got some congratulating handshakes from several successful lawyers offering her business cards and asking her to e–mail in her resume. Angela was picked up and taken to a nearby hotel by the man in the brown hat, who turned out to be a very successful single lawyer in California. Diane and her husband, Roy kissed in jubilation at the center of the stage. As Mandy Smith walked out of the banquet hall holding hands with her boyfriend Doug Welsh, she couldn&#8217;t help but think that it had been a very special evening in many ways.<br />
