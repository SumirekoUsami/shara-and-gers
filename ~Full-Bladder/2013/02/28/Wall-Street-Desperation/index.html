                <p>&#8220;Burns Tower– Even his building sounds scary.&#8221; Karen Squire thought to herself, opening one of the two giant glass doors with gold–plated handles. It was by no means the tallest tower in New York City, but definitely one of the city&#8217;s finest. It had been constructed over the past two years, 1988 and 1989.The rumour on the street whispered that it had cost Stephen Burns Jr. over twenty million dollars.Glancing at the directory sign, Karen confirmed that she was going to the top floor and hit the elevator button. She took a sip of her large coffee as the elevator arrived. It had been a restless night, with a big day looming. She had finally fallen asleep around 3 am, only to be awakened by her alarm four hours later. She had drunk an entire pot of coffee to wake up and had purchased another coffee on her fifteen minute walk to work.Standing nearly six feet tall, Karen was cute enough to make it as a model in New York City. However, that would be a shameful waste of her smarts and years of hard work. As a finance major at Harvard University with a 3.90 <span class="caps">GPA</span>, she had received multiple employment offers even before graduating. After accepting a position with a major Wall Street investment bank, she had become a rising star on the trading floor. She went out of her way to meet with wealthy businessmen, who were thrilled to sit down and talk money with an attractive, sophisticated lady. That was only half the story– Karen had made many investors very happy over the past five years, using savvy investing strategies that consistently beat the market. Stephen Burns Jr., a wealthy immigrant from Scotland, was in the process of assembling a dream team to manage his personal wealth in New York. Karen&#8217;s work had caught his eye, so he had quickly offered her twice the salary any investment bank could afford. At 27 years of age, Karen had already made it &#8220;big&#8221; in the Big Apple.Karen admired her reflection in the mirrored elevator. She smoothed out her light grey dress pants and straightened white blouse under the matching jacket, attempting to &#8220;lift up&#8221; her 28A breasts. Her pants were a snug fit and showed off her shapely ass. She worked hard to maintain a slim figure, visiting the gym three times a week. As the elevator stopped, she adjusted her shoulder–length, chestnut–brown hair and turned to face the door. She inhaled deeply, feeling her heart pound against her chest.The door opened a few yards from a receptionist&#8217;s desk. The lady smiled as Karen approached and greeted her. &#8220;Hi! You must be Karen– Mr. Burns has told me all about you. Please have a seat and I&#8217;ll let him know you&#8217;re here. Oh– I&#8217;m Megan by the way. Nice to meet you!&#8220;Before Karen could reply to the gleeful, chatty receptionist, she rushed off to find her boss. Karen sat down and looked at her watch. There were still six minutes left before she was supposed to start work. Megan hurried back to the desk a minute later and told her that Mr. Burns would be out shortly to receive her. Karen quickly gulped down the remainder of her coffee and threw the plastic cup in the trash.Karen waited nervously for ten minutes before a grey–haired man with a cane finally emerged from the door behind the reception desk. He simply waved at her, signalling to follow him. He briefly held the door open behind him, as he continued walking with a slight limp. Karen studied the trading room around her in awe. It was equipped with 1989&#8217;s best technology. There was a computer at every desk along with two phones. There were a total of six desks, four of them already occupied by men in their mid–30s to early–40s. They all glanced up to catch a glimpse of Karen before burying their heads back into their work, analyzing newspapers and charts to try to gain an edge when the trading day kicked off in twenty minutes.Mr. Burns led Karen into his corner office; she gasped inaudibly at the heart–stopping view of Wall Street below. They sat down and Mr. Burns got straight to business, addressing her in his deep Scottish accent. &#8220;The first thing you should know is that you are here to make money for me. If you fail to do that– seven hours a day, Monday to Friday, you are done here.&#8220;He paused to take a deep breath. Karen nodded that she understood. &#8220;Now, I expect you to give me everything you have. I will be watching and helping you this week. If I am satisfied with your work, you will invest my money on your own, without my guidance. I will warn you that working for me is not easy– a boy just quit last week after only two days here.&#8221; He waved two fingers at Karen for emphasis. &#8220;I have heard good things about you but I am not sure you will last here. You are a woman after all and I have always believed that the stock market is a man&#8217;s game.&#8220;Karen fumed and opened her mouth to ask him why he had even bothered hiring her. She caught herself just in time and politely thanked him for the opportunity. She noticed Mr. Burns was studying her carefully as she spoke. Karen realized that he was probably testing how well she controlled her emotions. He stood up to lead Karen to her desk. Mr. Burns instructed Karen to turn on the computer and handed her a paper containing all the necessary information she would need, including phone numbers, an ID, and a password.The moment the large clock on the wall hit 9:30, there was chaos. Phones were ringing non–stop, newspapers were flying and being torn apart, and the traders scrambled to get their orders in. Mr. Burns was yelling instructions at Karen as she struggled to make calls to gather information and place orders with various brokers. On top of all this, she could feel a growing need to pee. All that morning coffee was quickly working its way down to her bladder and she had no idea when she would get a break!An hour into the trading day, Mr. Burns finally cut back his yelling. Karen had made several profitable trades, despite her unfamiliarity with some of the brokers, phone numbers, and investments. Mr. Burns, needing a break, gave Karen a few instructions before leaving her on her own for the first time. Karen watched him walk into the only washroom on the floor and groaned. Her bladder was really becoming an annoyance now, filling rapidly as a result of the coffee&#8217;s diuretic effect.To Karen&#8217;s dismay, Mr. Burns returned to her side a few minutes later, after using the toilet. This gave her no opportunity to relieve her own need at all! He picked up one of Karen&#8217;s phones and called Megan to bring coffee. Five minutes later, Karen had yet another mug of coffee in front of her. She forced herself to sip slowly as she worked, not wanting to disappoint her boss. The coffee seemed to give the elderly man new energy, and his yelling increased once again.By 11, Karen had her legs clenched together tightly under her desk. She really needed to pee now and Mr. Burns wasn&#8217;t slowing down. She had already made him close to $4,000 and he was quite giddy over being on a profitable run. Karen couldn&#8217;t help but wonder just how much money he had– the account she was managing held over 1.5 million dollars.Kiran jittered her legs desperately, debating if she should interrupt her boss&#8217; relentless chain of commands to announce that she needed a pee break. She had a strong bladder and could hold her pee for a long time, a by–product of her above average height. Usually, she only peed once during work hours– at lunch. Today was a different matter though, as she had drunk over three times her usual volume of coffee and was now paying the price.By 11:30, Karen was squirming in her seat. Her abdominal area was causing her intense pain and she knew she <span class="caps">HAD</span> to get to the toilet soon. Mr. Burns was so focussed on the stock market that he still hadn&#8217;t noticed her mounting desperation. The other men had been sneaking peeks at Karen all day and had noticed the obvious wriggling. Karen&#8217;s show was making it very difficult for them to concentrate.With her bladder dominating her thoughts, Karen&#8217;s work pace had slowed down considerably. This led to even more yelling from Mr. Burns, behind her. Finally Karen had enough; she turned her chair around to face her boss, almost squirting in her panties as she did.&#8220;I need to use the washroom, Mr. Burns,&#8221; she said, trying to appear as composed as possible. She didn&#8217;t want to announce her need to the other men in the room. Her boss glanced down to observe her shaking legs, before replying. &#8220;I need you to sell Apple and Microsoft and buy Goldcorp immediately. After that you can take a break.&#8220;Containing her anger once again, Karen picked up the phone to place sell orders for the 2,000 Apple and 4,500 Microsoft shares. Ten minutes later, she received a reply phone call, confirming the sale. By then she had her hand stuffed in her crotch, just barely holding on. Her bladder was pulsating violently, threatening to release its ocean into her dress pants. Karen was in danger of having her first pee accident in fifteen years.As she dialled again to place the final order, Karen felt a squirt escape her pee–hole. She quickly got up from her chair and thrust her hand deep into her crotch again. Every man in the room watched as she danced helplessly at her desk, phone held to her ear. She gasped out the buy order, barely able to concentrate as the broker on the other end repeated the information. She squirted again despite holding herself tightly.Karen slammed down the phone and hobbled towards the toilet with both hands in her crotch. She was SO desperate– more desperate than she could ever remember being. What a horrible time to be on the verge of wetting her pants! She moved slowly, knowing she was about to lose all control. Even with her tiny deliberate steps, she squirted every few seconds. She knew there was a wet spot on her bum now and everyone in the room was eying it as she edged her way to the toilet.Somehow, Karen made it to the washroom door. As she removed a hand from her crotch to turn the knob, the strongest squirt yet escaped her body. She felt her hot pee seep down the back of her left leg, dampening her skin–tight pants. She desperately tried to unbutton her pants as she entered the washroom.One of the men had left the toilet running. The sound of running water was too much and Karen knew she had lost the battle. An overwhelming spasm ran through her and with a quick shiver, Karen started wetting her pants. Too shocked and devastated to move, she stood frozen on the spot as her pee soaked the light grey pants into a black colour. A powerful flood drenched her legs and flowed across the washroom floor.As she finished emptying her bladder, Karen realized the washroom door was still open and all the men were gawking at her in shocked silence. Too humiliated to turn around, she remained locked in place with her legs crossed for a full minute. Finally, Mr. Burns walked into the washroom and handed her a towel, bluntly informing her that she had exactly five minutes to dry off and return to her desk.<br />
