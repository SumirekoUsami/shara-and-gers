                <p>This is a true story that happened to me a while back.<br />
It was beautiful sunny day in the little seaside town I had grown up in England. It was also going to be a very special day. There had been a group of 40–50 of us who had graduated from grammar school and had just finished our first year at University. Since we had all been about 14 years old we had held a big beach bonfire party every July 1st to celebrate the end of the school. This party was going to be very special, as many of us hadn’t seen each other for months.<br />
I had changed a lot in the year I’d been away. I had been 20 pounds overweight and could generously have been classified as ‘chunky’. My redeeming features were my C–cups and gorgeous long blond hair. Over the past year I had slimmed out, cut my hair really short, lost my virginity and had many other pretty exciting things happen in my life. So here I was again, ready to go the beach party, this time determined not to be a wallflower, but to flaunt my new looks. I was also dying to see my friend John again. We had dated sporadically since we’d been 14, but were more friends than any kind of lovers. He was always the one boy friend I could go to and talk with – and he actually listened.<br />
I put on my special bikini which showed my ample cleavage, a pair of tight jean shorts and a loose cotton shirt. Arriving just as it was getting dark I grabbed myself a beer and caught up on all the gossip with my girlfriends. Well into my third beer, I noticed John had arrived and had his arm around another blonde. My heart sank until one of my girl friends told me it was his cousin from London who was staying with him for the week. She also told me that Nicki, an old enemy of mine, was on the prowl for him tonight so I had better be careful.<br />
For the last twenty minutes I had felt the pressure building up in my bladder as the beer worked its way through – the tight shorts certainly weren’t helping either. I decided to wander away from the party towards some bushes and go pee before talking to John. My first year at college had shown me that I had a large bladder for a girl my size but I was feeling very uncomfortable and really needed to go. I took my jean shorts off and dropped them on the knacksack I had brought with me and started to move towards relief. Just then I felt a hand on my shoulder, a familiar voice in my ear, and I was whirled around to face John. <br />
“Gail. How are you ? You look absolutely stunning !” he said, briefly staring down my cleavage before looking into my eyes. We traded news for a few minutes, and then someone put some slow dance music in the boom box and he asked me to dance. I was just about to tell him that I needed a minute until I saw Nicki hovering around so I just bit my tongue and nodded. It felt great to be in his arms again, but difficult to concentrate on the guy of my dreams with what felt like two pints of beer sloshing around inside me. Thinking fast, I waited until the tune finished and then suggested that we go for a walk to catch up. I figured this way I’d get him away from Nicki at the party and it would easier for me to go pee once we were on one of the paths at the back of the beach.<br />
He put his hands on my bottom, squeezed me tightly and gave me a hug. I wasn’t sure if that warm feeling between my legs was desire or recycled Heineken. I was in agony walking up the beach, barely holding it together as I tried to make conversation with John. Walking up the big steps to the trees and bushes I felt a couple of small spurts trickle into my bikini bottoms and was really grateful it was so dark. As soon as we got to a secluded area I turned to John to excuse myself, opened my mouth to speak – and he suddenly grabbed me and gave me an enormous, incredibly sexy kiss and hugged me tightly. I was so stunned I lost control and a huge torrent of pee shot out from me and cascaded down between my legs, totally soaking the knees and feet of my heart–throb.<br />
I was horrified, pulled back from the kiss and shoved my hands into my bikini bottoms to stop the flow. That was a hopeless task and I just stood there, crouched over, continuing to empty my bladder for what seemed like a minute. I finally looked up, tears in my eyes, to see a big smile on Johns face. “I’ve never had that kind of effect on a girl before,” he laughed and held out his arms to me. I noticed a huge bulge in his shorts, and suddenly realized that he was very turned on. Somehow all my shame melted away and I came to the conclusion that I was just as horny as he was.<br />
We frantically pulled off each others soaking wet shorts and dropped as a tangled mess of limbs to the grass, carefully avoiding the sizeable puddle I’d created. I swear that evening was the most satisfying night of sex I had ever had. In the first five minutes we both had incredible orgasms and lay there on the ground giggling, as we were afraid the rest of the group would investigate all the noise we were making.<br />
About thirty minutes later I realized I had to pee again, as did John. I straddled him, completely naked, over his chest facing towards his feet, putting his slowly hardening cock into my cleavage. After considerable coaxing, both because of his erection and the newness of the situation, he emptied himself all over my chest. I then slid down, allowed him inside of me, and slowly rode him to another climax. As I started to come I just completely relaxed my muscles and lubricated his balls with my warm flow. I can still remember that evening to this very day.<br />
The happy ending: We have been married for sixteen years, have three children – and every July 1st we still have a date by the beach.<br />
