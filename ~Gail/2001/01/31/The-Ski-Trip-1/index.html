                <p>This is part 1 of a series, loosely based on some facts.<br />
Susan was feeling pretty good about herself right about now. She hadn’t been skiing for over five years, in fact, since her senior year at college. After a few near–misses and one head–over–heels fall it had all come flooding back and she had spent the last hour traversing down several of the medium–blue slopes with two of her more athletic friends. To top it all off she had also finally managed to get away with Jeff, her newly acquired boyfriend and things were going so well on the skip trip she had to pinch herself to make sure she wasn’t dreaming. Sue and Jeff had been dating for a couple of months and she was sensing that the relationship was starting to develop into something more. Before they went any further Sue realized she had to introduce her pee and hold–it games to Jeff but couldn’t figure out how. They had arrived in the village early the previous evening, along with three other couples, and were sharing a house for the week. Sue had traded in many favors to ensure she got the master room with the king–sized bed and oversized bathtub. They had all gone out for dinner that night and Sue had a few beers. Sue and Jeff stayed on after the others to have coffee and then walked back to the house. The cold air had a predictable effect on Sue’s bladder and she had to keep a hand shoved deep into her pants pocket pressing against her pee hole to make sure she didn’t have an accident too soon. By the time she was opening up the front door she was ready to burst. Getting back into the warm house relieved the pressure a little but she still kept a hand discreetly pressed between her legs. Closing the bedroom door behind him, Jeff turned to Sue, kissing her and placing both hands on her butt cheeks to pull her closer. Within minutes they were both standing there naked, surrounded by a pile of clothes. Jeff obviously hadn’t noticed the tiny wet patch in her panties and backed her up a few paces against the wall, lifting her up and entering her, slowly moving in and out. Sue moaned gently and then said I have good news and bad news, which do you want first? Both at once, said Jeff. Sue hesitated, well, I’m going to have an incredible orgasm in about two minutes and my bladder is going to explode in about two minutes. Jeff abruptly withdrew from her, saying I’d better let you go, we don’t want to ruin the hardwood floors. Sue slowly, and a little dejectedly, walked into the bathroom soaking wet between her legs, but for all the wrong reasons as far as she was concerned. Sitting down on the toilet she leant back a little and opened her legs wide to pee. Just as the first trickle came out, Jeff walked in and told Sue that he was absolutely bursting too and was really glad that she had the courage to say something as he was far too embarrassed. Sue decided to give him the full show, shifting her bottom towards the back of the seat and let the floodgates loose. Her stream powered into the bowl, as if someone had turned on a fire hose at full force. Jeff was standing there totally entranced, mesmerized by the flow bursting forth from between her legs. Sue slid her two fingers down into the shape of an inverted V and opened up her swollen pussy lips, doubling the force of the watery cascade and nearly diverted her pee stream over the toilet seat and onto the floor by his feet before hastily readjusting her aim downwards. After what seemed like minutes the pressure eased off and Sue managed a couple of final spurts before declaring herself empty. Jeff was speechless and still rampantly erect. Well, aren’t you going to have problems taking a whizz like that? she giggled, lifting herself off the seat and kneeling in front of him. Gripping the base of his swollen dick she gently took the head into her mouth, working her tongue, lips and hand in tandem. Just a few seconds later she felt his thigh muscles tense and gave a few final flicks of her tongue before pulling away. Jeff literally exploded only a few inches away from her still open mouth and released his come over her mouth and chin. Wiping her mouth clean with a washcloth Sue stood up and gently leant against him. Several minutes passed as they just held each other before Jeff released his grip and moved towards the toilet. Sue would have been quite happy to let him pee all over her but decided to take it one step at a time. Moving up behind Jeff she wrapped both hands around him and gripped his now slippery and flaccid cock. Jeff started slowly, and his stream looked strange as it was mixed with all his fluids and looked almost oily. He rapidly gained speed and volume and Sue started to move his manhood from side to side and up and down, playing with stream and making it go in circles. Jeff finished, wiped himself and turned around to give Sue a big kiss. Sue asked him how he felt and Jeff began to describe the sensation of having a full–bladder orgasm. Jeff said it was like a nice form of pain being so full yet unable to do anything about it. He smirked and shyly mentioned that he’d like to do it again some time. Sue figured this was her chance and said that she’d like to try it too as it was supposed to be very intense for a girl. Jeff wanted to know how she’d manage to hold it and Sue replied that she probably couldn’t but that was half the fun. Sue held her breath and realized that this was the point at which she’d either bring Jeff over to the dark side or he’d be lost. She reached down and gently cupped his balls, noting how much Jeff had enjoyed it and it was only fair she try it. Let me think about that, he eventually said, but maybe you had better have another beer while I do, he added with a big smile on his face. Sue wandered over to the refrigerator by the bedroom door and grabbed two beers, opening them and handing one to Jeff. Sensing his agreement she rapidly consumed her beer, also taking several mouthfuls of his. OK, let’s try this, he said. I would love to do it on the bed but it would wreck the sheets and mattress and we are guests here, so I guess we had better move back to the bathroom. He grabbed her hand and pulled her into the bathroom, then took several of the big bath towels and laid them on the floor and then he laid down on them. Sue started to bend down over him but Jeff pushed her back and told her to get two more beers. When Sue rushed back into the bathroom she saw Jeff lying there on floor with his cock sticking way up into the air. Sue took a deep breath and climbed on top of him. She immediately felt the pressure on her bladder and let out a tiny dribble right away. Slowly rocking backwards and forwards using her hips Sue guzzled down her beer and began to feel an intense sensation way deep inside. She started to worry that she would pee before anything else happened. The feeling grew and grew and Sue realized that this was her climax approaching like a freight train rushing down on her. Her thigh muscles started to tremble and she felt a tiny wet stream dripping along her butt crack. Suddenly the orgasm was upon her. Every muscle and tendon in her body contracted and then relaxed and she was pounding herself into Jeff as the pee gushed out of her and down his shaft. As the final contraction hit her she lifted up so that only the top of his cock was inside her and her pee stream hit his belly button. Then she collapsed down on him, totally spent. Several minutes passed until she looked up at him, somewhat surprised at the big grin on his face. &#8220;What about me? You had better keep going!&#8221; Sue lifted herself back up and started to slide him in and out of her sopping wet hole. Jeff’s breathing became deeper and deeper and then he suddenly reached up to her, cupped her breasts and lifted almost his entire body off the floor as he came inside her. Sue felt drunk, exhausted, very wet and thoroughly happy. But there was more to come. I need to go again too, Jeff whispered, can I just let go? Sue murmured her agreement and felt Jeff pee inside of her and then leak out around his cock. Sue was amazed at the feelings as this was something she had never tried before. She suddenly realized the warm, wet sensation for what it was and pressing her hips down hard she had another, but softer orgasm. Oh my, she thought, I have six more days of this&#8230; and six more nights too. Next: Going, Going, Gondola – desperation on the ski lift <br />
