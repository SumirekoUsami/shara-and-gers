Susan’s legs were beginning to ache, deep down inside her thigh muscles. Her first ski trip for five years, combined with last night’s activities with Jeff were beginning to take their toll. She was grateful when someone in the group suggested they stop at one of the little chalets dotting the side of the mountain for a drink. She gently glided to a halt, clicked out of her skis, loosened her boots and followed everyone inside. The chalet was a family–run business, serving about 30–40 people at most. Their specialty was Gluhwein – heated red wine liberally laced with herbs and spices. She sat down on Jeff’s lap and held her glass as they all toasted each other. Sue immediately felt a slight buzz from the alcohol and the all too familiar twangs inside her as the wine added to the two breakfast coffees already in her bladder. Not wanting to risk anything in front of all her friends Sue moved towards the single unisex toilet and saw a line of six or seven skiers already there. Meanwhile the rest of her group was already outside putting on their skis. &#8220;Oh well,&#8221; she thought, spun around and started to put her skis on too. Jeff, who was leading the gang that morning, shouted &#8220;OK everyone, we’re going to ski down to the end of this run, and then take the gondola up to the top of the mountain for lunch.&#8221; Sue figured waiting another 20–25 minutes would be a breeze, so she pulled her ski goggles down over her eyes and started off down the slope. Although she wasn’t the most experienced skier she was pretty athletic and didn’t have any trouble keeping up except when they went down the really difficult ‘black’ slopes. She did notice that every time she turned the elastic waistband pushed into her aching bladder so she pointed her skis straight down the slope and beat everyone to the bottom, including Jeff. The gondolas were small and only took four people at a time, so Sue and Jeff teamed up with Monica and Aaron to wait in line. Sue spoke up &#8220;Hey, guys, I have to go visit the ladies – that wine went straight through me!&#8221; Jeff grinned back at her &#8220;Sue, it’s only a 5 minute ride and we’ll be on our gondola in just a couple of minutes. There is a big ladies room right at the top so can you wait about 10 minutes?&#8221; Sue was going to ignore him when Monica piped in &#8220;I need to pee as well, but I can certainly wait ten minutes.&#8221; Sue gave an exasperated sigh, squeezed her legs together and got back in line. Their gondola soon came swinging by. They put their skis in a rack on the back of the carriage and climbed in. The gondola was completely enclosed, with two double seats facing up the mountain and glass windows from about waist height up 6 feet to the ceiling. The attendant swung the doors closed behind them and the gondola leapt into the sky, swinging from side to side until it gathered speed. Sue sat in the back with Jeff, discreetly holding herself with her right hand stuck in the pocket of her jumpsuit. The ride was actually quite an experience and the view was awesome. It was just that every time the gondola went past a support strut it would shake up and down for about ten seconds. Looking ahead Sue saw the ski lodge at the top of the fountain and figured she’d be out of her predicament in less than five minutes. Suddenly there was a strange metal–on–metal grinding noise, and the gondola slowed down and eventually stopped. &#8220;Oh, no&#8221;, Sue yelled, shoving both her hands into her crotch. Aaron, trying to re–assure her, said &#8220;Sue – it’s OK, we are perfectly safe up here. You have nothing to worry about – this happens all the time. One of the gondolas gets jammed and they have to release it.&#8221; Sue couldn’t care if she was safe or not, she just knew that she was the one who had to release, and soon. Her bladder was stretched to the limit, swelling out below her belly button and crying out for relief. Sue was busy calculating her options. She was wearing a powder–blue all–in–one jumpsuit, with only thermal underwear and a t–shirt on underneath. If she even managed to get her jumpsuit off she’d be practically naked and freezing cold. She did decide to come clean about her situation – &#8220;Guys, I can’t wait any longer, if we don’t start moving right now I’m going to have to go right here!&#8221; Monica turned around and by looking into her eyes Sue could tell that she wasn’t very far behind her in the desperation situation. Even though it was below freezing in the gondola she felt a droplet of sweat run down her back. She was squeezing her muscles together so hard it was like a workout. At that moment a spasm ran through her lower body, she bit her lip in pain, and she knew the time had come. &#8220;OK – that’s it, you two keep looking forward and talk among yourselves. Jeff – you can help me.&#8221; Sue unzipped her jumpsuit all the way down between her aching legs and swiveled from side to side to get her arms out. Quickly lifting her bottom off the seat she tried to slide the jumpsuit under her. The effort of lifting up made her relax some of her other muscles and she felt a small dribble leak out into her panties. The jumpsuit was so bulky she could only get it halfway down her thighs before it was all pushed up against the top of her ski boots. Another spasm hit her, resulting in another panty spurt and she frantically pulled her panties down as far as they would go – gasping at how cold the air felt on her wet lips. The worst thing about her position was that she could open her legs 6–8 inches at most because of the jumpsuit. Sitting right on the edge of the seat, Sue pressed her thighs apart, lifted up her feet, and let go. Within a second the gondola was full of that familiar hissing sound as Sue’s stream hit the floor. Her urine pounded against the metal with such force it sounded like a small rainstorm. In the front seat Monica suddenly jumped up, exclaiming &#8220;shit, shit, shit&#8221; while trying to rip off her ski pants. &#8220;The zipper’s stuck!&#8221; she screamed, and then gasped as a dark–colored stain spread across the front of her pants and down the inside of both legs. Sue meanwhile, was still pissing as if her life depended upon it. A loud crack startled everyone as the gondola lurched forward, causing Sue to lose her balance as she launched her pee stream into the air and over Aaron’s left shoulder. Through her tears she saw it hit the window in front of him and started to laugh uncontrollably. Finally her powerful stream became a trickle and then with a final little spurt she was done. Pulling her jumpsuit back up she managed to get dressed before the gondola arrived at the top station. Walking off the gondola she looked over at Monica and a very unhappy Aaron and then whispered to Jeff &#8220;so who is worse off? Other than a damp pair of panties I’m fine and she has to go buy a new outfit and get changed. Plus I’m sure you’ll be extra horny tonight remembering this. Straight laced ol’ Aaron will probably never want to touch Monica again.&#8221; &#8220;Well, that’s his problem isn’t it?&#8221; Jeff laughed. &#8220;Five more days,&#8221; thought Sue. &#8220;I’m going to run out of clean underwear.&#8221;<br />
