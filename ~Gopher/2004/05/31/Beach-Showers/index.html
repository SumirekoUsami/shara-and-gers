                <p>Author&#8217;s They were identical twins– friends of my daughter, blonde, busty, and beautiful too. They were always teasers and knew how to do it, and how far it was safe to go as well. At least I used to think so. On the day that it happened, we were taking a trip to the beach. No, not the main public beach where everyone went, but a small slightly secluded beach, which was usually quiet because there were no shops ice cream vans or candy stalls around. When we arrived, Helena (my daughter) and I had our beach/swim wear on under our clothes so we went straight to the beach but Josie and Charlene, the twins, went to the ladies&#8217; to change first.<br />
Helena is an excellent swimmer and she loves swimming, so she went straight into the sea as soon as she had taken off her other clothes. I stripped off down to my trunks but lay down on the sand, closed my eyes and soaked up the sun. After a short while I was conscious of something or someone blocking my sun and when I opened my eyes there stood Charlene and Josie in the briefest of brief bikinis by the side of me. I said, &#8220;Hi you look nice,&#8221; and with a smile they replied &#8220;Thank you.&#8221; Then they looked at each other and winked with a wicked smile on their faces. Both of them stepped across so they were standing astride me, one over my face, and the other over my waist.<br />
As I looked up first at one and then the other I was gob smacked to see that they both had their bikini bottoms pulled slightly to one side affording me a magnificent view of their completely shaven pussies. I opened my mouth to say something but the words just would not come out. I must have looked a right haddock laying there, my mouth opening and closing like a fish. Then without warning a few drops of golden liquid descended onto my face– followed by a stream and then a gusher as Josie peed onto my head and face. I was so shocked I could neither say nor do anything for a few moments. Then, as she stopped, Charlene started to pee too, completely soaking my trunks and then aiming it expertly onto my cock which was by now as stiff as a poker and straining at my trunks, pushing them up like a tent.<br />
I grabbed Josie by the waist and pulled her down on top of me, licking off drops of pee that remained on her pussy and then licking and tonguing her to a shattering orgasm. Meanwhile, Charlene had finished peeing and had decided it was her duty to clean me up a bit. She had pulled my trunks down just sufficient to get where she wanted and was licking around by testicles and up the shaft of my knob. As Josie rolled gently off when her earth shattering orgasm was over, Charlene spun round and stuffed her soaking pussy in my face. We sucked and licked each other until we both had tremendous orgasms, Charlene groaning and screaming like crazy as she climaxed and then simultaneously I let go, being unable to hang on any longer, and shot my load all over her gorgeous face.<br />
When we had recovered sufficiently we all ran down into the sea and splashed around as we cleaned ourselves up.<br />
That was the first adventure that the three of us had together. There were many more, but they&#8217;ll have to wait for another time.<br />
