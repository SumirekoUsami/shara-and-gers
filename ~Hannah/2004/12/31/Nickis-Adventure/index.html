                <p>Nicki is a friend of mine, and I had never heard of her peeing until she told me a true story she experienced.<br />
Nicki, just turning 19, blonde, slim body, had never been in a desperate situation in her life. She woke up in the morning, just like any other morning, and she was going off campus to visit one of her friends. Her car was in the repair shop, so she had to take the bus for an hour trip, plus a long walk from there to reach her friends.<br />
She got up in the morning, took a shower, and did all the other things a normal person would do. She got dressed in a light blue top with a black mini skirt. She used the restroom, and then consumed some coffee before leaving. It was a 10–minute walk to the nearest bus stop, and she looked at the time, seeing that she was running late. She hurried to the bus stop, only to find the bus leaving as she got up to the bus stop. She was feeling awful, and called up her friend to tell her she would be late since she missed the bus. Meanwhile, she went to a nearby Starbuck&#8217;s and bought some coffee to drink. She stuck around for a while and left to go back to the bus stop. After nearly 45 minutes since the last bus left, the next bus came, so she got on and off it was toward her friends&#8217; house.<br />
She had brought along a water bottle since it was a pretty hot day already. She drank her water, and 20 minutes into the 1–hour drive, she finished her water. As time passed by, Nicki felt a little urge to pee. She just endured it like any other time, when she needed to go slightly, and then find a bathroom to pee. But with another 15 minutes to go in the drive, the pressure started increasing. She would not only have to wait till she got off the bus, but also had a long walk toward her friends&#8217; house since there were no bus stops around there. Nicki knew that she would quickly have to find a restroom. That was her first priority at the time. She would take a detour and go off looking for a restroom.<br />
Unfortunately for her, she did not know the place very well. She did not even know exactly where her friends&#8217; house was, although she had directions with her. Nicki got off the bus, and looked around to see if there was a park or a store nearby where she could use the restroom. She decided to head toward the direction of her friends&#8217; house to see if there was anywhere she could urinate. There was a park she saw, a small one, and so she rushed over to look for a restroom. She saw the map on which it showed where all the city parks were, and what features each park had. She looked at it and saw that the park she was in had no restroom. Most of the small town&#8217;s parks had no restrooms.<br />
Nicki was feeling very needy at this point. She headed out of the park, and started to rush toward her friends&#8217; house, which was still another 3–mile walk. She decided that would probably be her best choice. But as she walked, pretty soon she had to stop to help control herself. She decided at that point that there was no chance of her making it to her friends&#8217; house before peeing. She started to desperately search for a store or something where there was a bathroom. As she walked a little distance, she came upon a Jamba Juice. She hoped that there would be a restroom there. When she got in, she saw how small the place was. She looked around for a restroom, but there was none. She almost cried, but headed out of the store. Reaching almost the top of her limit, she decided that the only thing she could do was to look for a place to pee outside in public. She headed through a busy area quickly and reached a less crowded area. She then saw a small alley behind a building. She looked around to make sure no one was looking, and quickly turned the corner and into the alley.<br />
Even though there was still no one, she did not want to pee yet. She hoped that she could just help relieve the pressure a little bit. She was now able to hold her crotch with no one around to watch her. She was still near the front of the alley, so she hopped her way over to the other end. She looked back to make sure no one was in sight. She suddenly felt her bladder hit the limit. She yelped out and the pee suddenly rushed out. She moved her skirt up to prevent it from getting wet, but she couldn&#8217;t move her thong out of the way. The pee poured for a minute, with a big stream coming out. She decided to just let all of the pee out as she was in an area where no one else was.<br />
Her thong was soaking wet, and she could not just go off like that, so she took off her thong, decided to take her chance, and wear nothing underneath her short skirt. She stayed in the alley for a few more minutes to try and dry off. It was her first ever experience, and she learned after that to take precautions when going out for a long trip. She arrived at her friends&#8217; house, where Nicki headed into the bathroom to dry herself off a little more. She took one of her friends&#8217; thongs, and wore it underneath the skirt. She just hoped that her friends wouldn&#8217;t notice it.<br />
