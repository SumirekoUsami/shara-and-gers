                <p>Note: This story contains Female Desperation, and Accidental &amp; Deliberate Wetting.<br />
One day I had to go to a business meeting in another town. For this meeting one of my female co–workers had to go with me. This co–worker was a close friend of mine; I&#8217;ll call her Amy. Amy and I were kidding around a lot of the time, and my boss tried to let us work together as little as possible, for we wouldn&#8217;t do much at all if we were together all the time. We were however, the best people in the business and we had to close this deal. At work we had the joy of working with a lot of people, so they were sad to see us go. We were going to go away for at least a month.<br />
One day we were going to a meeting and she said she had to pee and asked if she could go to the toilet. I told her not to go and she said she had to pee her pants then. I said she didn&#8217;t dare to do that and after she looked at her crotch and her legs she said she didn&#8217;t dare indeed for we had to go to our meeting. She went to the toilet.<br />
I thought that was that but a few days later when we came out of a meeting she made the same remark about needing to go. We did the same discussion with me saying she didn&#8217;t dare to pee her pants again. She looked at her legs and crotch and said she didn&#8217;t dare indeed for we still had to go out for dinner. She went to the toilet.<br />
Again a few days later we had the day off and were at the hotel pool. She was wearing a black swimsuit and again made the comment about needing to pee. The same discussion with me saying she didn&#8217;t dare to pee her swimsuit. She looked around and under her chair. She said she didn&#8217;t dare indeed for she was afraid anyone could see her pee and got up. She jumped in the pool and swam four laps. When she came out she said she didn&#8217;t have to go anymore. Now this was beginning to get interesting.<br />
I must tell you I didn&#8217;t get into every remark she made about peeing because I didn&#8217;t want it to be too obvious that I was more than kidding. To this day I don&#8217;t know whether she was interested in pee fun herself, or if she found my first reaction strange and decided to test me further, or if it was all harmless fun from her point of view.<br />
About a week later at the pool when we were going to our rooms she said she had to go to the toilet before we went to lunch, so it would take some more time, if I was willing to wait. I said I was famished and didn&#8217;t want to wait longer than necessary. We were in the elevator and she said she&#8217;d better pee her swimsuit here then, it would take less time to do it now than it would take later. I said she didn&#8217;t dare to do that and she just smiled. Suddenly I heard a hissing sound and her crotch and legs started to glisten. A pool of urine formed around her feet and she was finished before we reached our floor. She said something like &#8216;yes, I do dare&#8217; and winked at me when she went into her room. We changed into clothes and went out for dinner, I couldn&#8217;t get the image of her pissing her swimsuit out of my head, and though I&#8217;m married I masturbated thinking about it that night and some other nights as well.<br />
A few days later when we were on the way back to the hotel Amy said she had to pee bad and wanted to walk faster to get there. I sighed and started to walk faster. She said she was sorry I had to hurry and I told her I was only kidding. There was nothing else to do if she had to pee this bad, now was there? She said she could pee her panties under her skirt as well. I said since she didn&#8217;t dare we had to walk fast, and she asked me– who said she didn&#8217;t dare? I told her to do it then if she dared and she stopped, looked around and took me into a quiet ally. She spread her legs and suddenly her piss came cascading down between her legs making a big puddle. After she was finished she giggled and said something like &#8216;see, I do dare&#8217; and winked at me. This was something again for me to wank over for a few days.<br />
Later that week we were at the pool again in the sun and she needed to pee. We were talking about work and were in the middle of a very difficult formulation of part of the deal. I told her I wanted to finish this first because we were writing an almost perfect piece now, and we would be out of it when she came back from the toilet. She said she just had to go now, and apologised if she embarrassed me and peed her bathing suit sitting in the chair. We finished our masterpiece and I started to revel in the memory of her just sitting there, peeing herself for all she was worth.<br />
That appeared to be the end of it. We were working very hard on the deal and were more times close to a toilet than not. We closed the deal three weeks later, a week sooner than expected, and the deal was better than anyone had hoped. We had saved many jobs, kept a factory fully operational and it had cost us less than we had expected and got more accomplished than we had hoped. We stayed one more day and than went home. When we were in the plane Amy went to the toilet but came back without peeing. Apparently the toilets were broken. Amy had drunk a lot of water and started to fidget by the time the plane was approaching the airport. When the plane had finally landed and we could get out, Amy was in trouble. She let everyone get out before her, whispering to me she wasn&#8217;t sure if she could make it. We got out and went looking for the nearest toilet. Suddenly she bent over and moaned. Apparently she was in pain. I just asked where the nearest toilets were and was told we had to go past customs to get there. Since we were at our destination we couldn&#8217;t go to the tax–free part of the airport to find a toilet there. Amy knew she was in trouble for we had to get our bags and then get past the customs for her to get to the toilets. That would take an hour at least at this airport and we both knew it. She asked me what she was going to do, and I told her she either had to hold it or pee her pants. She moaned and asked me if I was going to tell our colleagues if she peed her pants and wasn&#8217;t I going to be mad at her. When I told her not to worry she just let it flow. Her pants got soaking wet and she made a big puddle. At that moment one of the flight attendants walked by and saw what had happened. She moaned and bent over, holding her crotch. She was in trouble as well. Suddenly she spread her legs and a river of pee cascaded down between her legs. She said something like wearing skirts was one of the advantages of being a flight attendant and walked away fast. I lent Amy my long coat and we went through customs without any trouble. Amy changed into something clean in the toilets and we have never talked about it since, though I noticed she started to wear skirts more often and once she had a lot of fluid in her waste bin. I never know whether she used it as a toilet or dumped some water in it.<br />
