                <p>Note: This story contains Female Desperation, Accidental &amp; Deliberate Wetting, and Sex.<br />
We hope you enjoy our contributions, if not for the writing, then just for knowing that what we write is true. Hopefully others will find wetting with a partner is not an empty dream, but with the right encouragement, something intimate and enjoyable for genuinely sharing.<br />
I have a very special relationship with my partner Val, which works very much for both of us. She modelled very successfully for a while, making very good money. She now works in the fashion industry and we have just started our own business. Although she is not turned on by wetting directly, she is happy to play my games and I hers. She will wet herself when she is feeling horny, as she knows this will get her the sort of attention she wants. For her part she enjoys role–playing, anything with a bit of risk in it, being restricted, and attractive girls. So we indulge each other.<br />
Our lifestyle is unusual in many ways, in that her work means she has to travel a fair bit, mostly to her native Italy but also to Paris and Madrid. We have an interesting sort of open relationship. She has a few female friends with whom she stays and tells me about their relationship. If she brings any of them home to our room, then they have agreed for me to join them both. I would love to say that I can keep going all night with both of them, but the truth is that experience is often so intense I really have to pace myself, and I enjoy watching them anyway. We have a selection of toys, which the girls enjoy, and they are more than happy to include them with me. It has certainly broadened my horizons, in more ways than one!<br />
Val is incredibly open and honest and has encouraged me to really come out of myself. Although she has had a couple of relationship with guys in the past, including one who was otherwise gay, she is not really interested in men apart from me and she often treats me as one of her girlfriends. I should add for those who have not read my previous letter that I love wearing women&#8217;s clothes.<br />
We have just bought a place together which is really exciting. I get to do all the housework and work from home on our business adventure. As our place is very secluded, I spend most of my time cross–dressed. I can spend days without having to put any male clothing on. I love it so much. Even when we go out together I am often wearing women&#8217;s jeans and tops, surprisingly I have found, quite a few guys do this. Val is so pretty, even without makeup, and dresses very stylishly. All eyes are on her anyway.<br />
As I said she loves slightly risky things. When we lived in town, we would go out for an evening and on the way home she would suggest I tie her to a tree in the park and make love to her. Another of her tricks was to sit on my lap on a bench and whilst kissing, just relax her bladder. We have had one or to close calls with this one.<br />
If she is wearing a short skirt or dark trousers she will indulge my wet fantasies in an alleyway, pretending to be a rather drunk, naughty girl. She knows what will happen when I get her home and she has plenty of time to look forward to it. She has even done it in a nightclub wearing black trousers. Okay, it does not show at all, but it feels and smells good. It is surprisingly easy to get away with this.<br />
Right from the start Val was never repulsed with our wetting ourselves. Almost from the beginning, we had to buy protection for the mattress, duvet and pillows, all readily available on Ebay.<br />
She does not like having to get up very early to catch flights. Especially if we are going to be apart for a few days she likes to leave me with a little something to remember her by. I have woken more than once to find her easing herself on top of me when I am still half asleep. She gently kisses me and strokes my hair. Just as I begin to relax and become aware, a hot torrent hits me right in the genitals.<br />
Half of me is thinking &#8216;Oh no&#8217;, and the other part is forming a tent in my nightie. She is not slow to take advantage of this. I roll her under me to lay her in the hot spot and give a very passionate performance. It is often just a quickie but she is very responsive, 0–60 in three seconds, typical Italian, but I consider it one of her very best qualities. After we come back to earth, she will wriggle out of bed and I get a soggy pair of panties and top to cuddle up to as she leaves to shower.<br />
With the covers over me, it remains very snug and I can quickly fall asleep. Waking later in a wet bed is something only a true aficionado would appreciate. I happily add to the mess by letting go my on bladder and lazily turn over to snuggle down again. However, all good things must come to an end. I have housework to do, including the laundry. Downstairs there will be a flower or chocolate for me in the kitchen with a note saying &#8216;Ciao&#8217;. Three or four days later she will be back hungry for attention again.<br />
Last week I picked her up from Heathrow. She was wearing a beautifully cut light grey trouser suit, very classic and understated, with black shoes and handbag, her long black her hanging over her shoulders. She was immaculately made up, having come directly from a business meeting. As soon as we got her luggage, we jumped in to the car and got out on to the M4. Straight away she said that she needed to go and that I should put my foot down. Now I am not one to waste petrol and am very keen to reduce my carbon footprint, therefore I settled for cruising at a steady 50mph. She kept imploring me to go faster but knew I would be deaf to her pleas.<br />
It took us just under an hour to get home. Rather a long hour for Val, if I am not mistaken. We parked up and took her bags from the car. I left her with the heavy ones as I was enjoying watching her struggle, and my thoughts were far from being gentlemanly at this stage. We were coming in the back way to the house and once we reached the patio she collapsed onto a garden chair, panting that she was not going to make it.<br />
I told her to stay there and rushed in to get her a drink. When she saw what I had brought her she broke into her native Italian. It is such an expressive language for swearing in. I told her to down it quickly and I would help her in. No sooner than she had placed the glass to her lips, she sat more upright, her knees parted and she made a small grunt. She tried to swallow but was constantly interrupted by her loss of focus.<br />
A dark patch spread from her crotch along her legs. A small pool erupted between them. Slowly the green plastic chair began to fill with warm liquid. It dripped from holes at the back and a small waterfall poured of the front. Gamely, Val tipped the chair back so as not to lose too much precious puddle. She finished her glass and looked down still filling the chair with hot urine and said &#8216;Ooops&#8217;. We both laughed.<br />
She sat for a bit and told me of her trip. She suggested we moved indoors as her puddle was cooling down. As she stood, fingers of liquid extended down the inside of the trousers and the back of her calves. Her ass was completely encased in dark material. The back of her jacket dripped constantly. From the front, her immaculate businesswoman image was contradicted by a broad dark, wet swathe on the inside of either leg. Slightly pigeon toed she minced in to the utility room where she turned and kissed me.<br />
I undid the zip at the back of her trousers and slid them down her stockinged legs. I admired the tidemark over her buttocks where her pink panties clung to her. With my fingers I explored the front. It was not long before her panties followed her trousers to the floor. With one leg out of her trousers she spread her legs and bent forward over the washing machine. I readied myself and holding her flanks, entered her from behind in a rather uncharacteristically macho way for me. It was the sort of welcome home for which we had both been waiting.<br />
Having cleaned up a bit we both headed off for a bath. Here I found that her bladder had refilled quickly and she was more than able to wash me down. It was good to have her back again. We both count ourselves as lucky to have what we have and will let you know when we have other experiences to share.<br />
