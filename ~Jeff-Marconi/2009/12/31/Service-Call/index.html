                <p>I pulled up to the address on my work ticket, and went to the door and knocked. She opened the door. &#8216;Wow,&#8217; I thought to myself. She was wearing a pair of tight denim shorts over black shiny hose. Her red top was tight on her body, and showed her full female form. She looked great at that moment. But she had a bounce to her step, like she was agitated about something. <br />
I asked her where the air conditioner was so I could start my task and distract myself from her tightly wrapped body. She told me she would show me what I needed in a minute. She offered me a glass of water and I accepted, and she poured herself one too. When she thought I couldn&#8217;t see her, I saw her cross her legs a bit, and shoot a hand to her crotch. I knew then what was the matter, and instantly, I felt my manhood begin to enlarge.<br />
She walked over slowly and handed me the water. She took down her tall glass in a few seconds and set the empty glass aside. She then showed me to another room in the house, equipped with all that you&#8217;d usually see in a den; her computer, a fake leather sofa and matching chairs, all on a black slate floor.<br />
She turned my attention to her air conditioner and began pressing a finger into her crotch again. It was now obvious that she was holding back a flood with that one small fingertip. I turned on the a/c, and as soon as it awoke, it must have jiggled the mouse on the computer because as it lit up, I was looking right at a user profile I had created on MySpace. How did she know? I had outlined my fantasies there, and had even found some pictures that went along with it to post (pictures of somebody else, of course).<br />
It was late in the day, and this would be my last stop of the day. And I was glad. She came over to the desk, and called up her user profile. I was rock–hard as she showed me pictures of her enjoying the same fetish as I. She didn&#8217;t let me look for long though, as she led me to her sofa and seated me. It was a deep sofa, and the way I landed had me leaning way back. <br />
She could clearly see my raging hard on through my slacks. She looked at my bulge, and gently stroked me through the now somewhat tight fabric. With the skill of a tailor, she had unhooked the fastener and had unzipped me. Slowly and delicately, she removed my pants and tossed them aside, exposing my tight fitting briefs. She was still fully dressed, and as she stood straight, I could see a small dark spot had formed at her mound.<br />
She put a knee on the sofa next to my leg, and then the other, with her winding up sitting on my knees. I was looking her in the eyes as I felt her fingertips ever so lightly stroking my fully erect shaft through my briefs. In kind, I replied by caressing her hard nipples through her tight shirt. She slid herself toward me, and put her hands in mine. She slid herself up to me, and I could feel the dampness in the wet patch in her shorts warm the head of my manhood. She leaned back, holding herself on me by holding my hands. She shuddered a bit, and at that moment, I felt a warm wetness flood on to me and down the front over my sack, and then pooling in the cushion below me. I almost came right then, but held myself back, knowing that this wasn&#8217;t over yet. She stopped the flow not long after it started, and pulled her self back to me. <br />
&#8220;Should I continue?&#8221; she asked, as if the erection I was displaying wasn&#8217;t enough of an answer. Without even realizing it, I had answered yes.<br />
She slid back and stood, but only long enough to remove the denim shorts and reveal the black pantyhose and red satin panties beneath. The dark red fabric around her crotch glistened with the wetness that she had made, and increased my arousal all the more. I sat up and cupped my hand over the wet gusset and gently slid it back and forth. She moaned a little at my touch, and almost instantly I felt her warm stream reawaken in the palm of my hand. I pressed my hand in a little, to be sure that she felt as much of what she was doing. Her clit had begun to press itself forward, and to my surprise raised a small bump in her wet red knickers. <br />
I laid her down on the sofa, and she stopped the flow. Without a second thought, I moved my face above her waist and proceeded to tease her clit with the tip of my tongue, right through her pee–soaked clothes. With the very first touch, she lost control for a moment, and I felt her warm jet tickle my lower lip. I moaned in approval. I teased the rest of her womanhood with my fingertips, gently teasing the fabric and thus her flesh below. She continued to lose her hot jet into the fabric, moaning as I worked her. <br />
I wanted her to feel more, so I tore open the gusset of her hose, and slid aside her panties. Her clit was as perked as I had ever seen before, and I continued what I had started with my tongue, this time without the fabric in the way. I slid two fingers into her soaking wet hole and gently felt around, teasing as many of the right spots as I could– in and out and around. I found her G–spot and began to gently massage it. It was too much for her to bear, and with a hard shudder and scream, she began to orgasm. As she came, she lost whatever control she had left, and laid there releasing the rest of her golden jet. I moved in closer so I could feel it shower my throbbing hard–on. <br />
A few moments later, she regained her composure and sat up. &#8220;It&#8217;s your turn,&#8221; she remarked.<br />
She had me sit back as earlier, and slid off my briefs. She fumbled in a drawer in the stand by the sofa and found a pair of scissors, which she used to cut through the wet red gusset of her panties, exposing her swollen slit completely. She straddled me and pressed her glory against my rock hard dick. She drained what little she had left onto my bare skin and sent my sensations through the roof. I was in a haze.<br />
I mustered all I could to force a jet to release, and after several tries, finally succeeded and washed all over her lower lips. She moved and pressed the end of me just in deep enough to feel her. Just then, I released another hot stream and began to fill her. She moaned again, and as she did, she released another spurt of her own onto me. I kept filling her, and when I didn&#8217;t think she could take any more; she clenched and flushed herself out onto us. She slipped on to me until I was as deep into her as could be, and all the time I had never stopped my stream. I felt her fill with me, and she began to slide herself up and down on me, releasing a gush of our combined juices whenever she reached the top. Her hands clamped on to me, and I could feel her tensing– her wet pussy clinching tighter and tighter with each thrust. The white fire was flaring up in me too, and suddenly, we both erupted into a fiery orgasm that left us both shaking and limp. <br />
I pulled her to me and held her in my arms as she laid her head on my shoulder. After a time, she arose and pulled open another drawer in the end table, and pulled out a towel. As we dried each other off, she told me she had another surprise for me for next time the air conditioner was &#8220;broken&#8221;.<br />
