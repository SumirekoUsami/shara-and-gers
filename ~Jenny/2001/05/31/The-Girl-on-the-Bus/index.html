                <p>I just wanted to tell you something that happened today on the bus&#8230; I was sitting there, waiting to get home, when I noticed a girl on the other aisle (kind of good looking) in a pair of black slacks and a red shirt – but she had her legs just a little open and a hand in between them, curled right up against herself! I watched her for a while, and she was rubbing herself– I could tell she either was dying to pee, or was playing with herself&#8230; As we got nearer to where she got off, she put her bag on her lap and curled up a little, then squeezed her eyes shut – and then put her hand between her legs for another rub! I was rather turned on now myself, and dying to know what she was doing! She then got off the bus (rather quickly I thought – she waited for the bus to stop and the door to open and bolted out), and on the material seat I could see a &#8220;patch&#8221; – when it was my turn to get off I quickly stopped at the seat and had a feel – yep, she had wet herself, right in front of me (and about 10 others) – I think I was the only one to notice though – and I sure enjoyed it. I only wish I knew whether she was just bursting or enjoying herself with a quick rub through her panties beforehand! I would like to think she was turning herself on, but I suppose I will never really know&#8230;Hope you enjoy thinking about it too..<br />
