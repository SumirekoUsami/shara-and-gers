            <div class="mt-4">
                <p>We were watching two 3–year–old girls. It was a hot summer day so we (my friend and I) had each had three 22 OZ. cokes. About half an hour later I began to feel the urge to pee. I ignored it and figured we would be leaving soon. About 45 minutes later my urge was getting to a state of emergency so I figured we had better get going. I told the two girls it was time to go and they started crying and begging to stay. Marcy, my friend, said, &#8220;Oh come on just let them play a bit more!&#8221; I figured I&#8217;d wait.<br />
Another 20 minutes went by. I was in urgent need now of a place to pee. I knew that even if we left then with the walking speed of those kids we wouldn&#8217;t be home for at least 30 minutes. It was a last resort, but I figured I had better use the public restroom. Uggh. That was going to be nasty. The ones in the park are just unbearable.<br />
I went over to the restrooms only to find them locked. I banged on the door in desperation, but it was no use. There was a sign up that they were out of order. I could feel the pressure on my bladder so strong. I could feel my pee on the verge of bursting out into my panties. I went back over to Marcy and blurted out &#8220;Ok we really must go now I <span class="caps">REALLY</span> <span class="caps">HAFTA</span> <span class="caps">PEE</span> <span class="caps">BAAAD</span>!!!&#8221; She said she had to also and suggested we use the public restrooms. I said they weren&#8217;t open and she said, &#8220;Oh my gosh! I was planning on using them before we left. I don&#8217;t know if I can last until we get back!&#8221;<br />
We told the children it was time to go and they put up such a fuss. They kept whining and running away and we had to keep chasing them (not easy on a full bladder). Finally, after 20 <span class="caps">VERY</span> long minutes we began to leave the park.<br />
We began walking back and I was right! Those kids walk slowly!! They wanted to walk and wouldn&#8217;t let us carry them. This was going to be tough. It was worse than I had expected though. The walk didn&#8217;t take the expected 30 minutes; it took 45!! I was absolutely bursting by the time we got back.<br />
The only problem was that Marcy also had to go real bad and they only had one bathroom. I was going to have to try to make it in there first. We got inside the apartment and I rushed in ahead of Marcy and got to the bathroom door in a hurry, only to find that it was locked. I banged on the door in desperation and a voice came from inside &#8220;I&#8217;ll be out in a minute.&#8221; Uggh. It was the girls&#8217; older sister. I danced around waiting for five minutes or so, barely able to keep my composure.<br />
Then the toilet flushed, a sound that just made the pain worse. She finally came out and I rushed in, only to notice that one of the girls I was sitting for had followed me. I asked her nicely to get out and she replied, &#8220;I want to use the potty like a big girl.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Ok, but not now you&#8217;ll have to wait, ok?&#8221; she said, &#8220;No!! I want to go <span class="caps">NOW</span>!!!&#8221; I was trying not to wet myself at the same time as trying to get her out of the bathroom. It wasn&#8217;t easy and I figured it might be easier if I just helped her use the potty and then relieved myself.<br />
I pulled her training pants down for her and sat her up on the toilet. My oh so desperate pussy throbbed as I waited desperately!! She just sat there. After what must have been 5 minutes I said to her &#8220;Are you sure you have to go?&#8221; &#8220;<span class="caps">YES</span>!!&#8221; she replied. I waited. After another two minutes there was finally a trickle in the toilet and then I urgently said, &#8220;Ok. All finished.&#8221; and she replied, &#8220;No! I&#8217;m not done yet.&#8221; I was on the verge of wetting myself and I didn&#8217;t know what to do. Marcy screamed from outside, &#8220;<span class="caps">ARE</span> <span class="caps">YOU</span> <span class="caps">ALMOST</span> <span class="caps">DONE</span> <span class="caps">YET</span>?!!! I&#8217;M <span class="caps">REAL</span>, <span class="caps">REAL</span> <span class="caps">DESPERATE</span> <span class="caps">OUT</span> <span class="caps">HERE</span>!!!!&#8221;<br />
I couldn&#8217;t even scream back. All my concentration was on keeping my desperate pussy under control. Another 5 minutes went by and more pee began to trickle into the toilet. That was it&#8230;I lost it. I began peeing in my pants. I didn&#8217;t know what to do so I jumped in the shower, closed the curtain, and just peed all over the tub. Marcy began to bang on the door. &#8220;<span class="caps">OHHHHHHHHH</span> my <span class="caps">GOSH</span>&#8221; she screamed and burst in, completely soaking herself. <br />
Needless to say, we never showed our faces at their house again!!<br />
