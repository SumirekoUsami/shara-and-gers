                <p>I regularly notice during mass that this stunning young girl in the choir at St. Stevens Cathedral is shifting around nervously from one foot to the other. Especially, towards the end of the hymns and being that St. Stevens is a Catholic church, the hymns are sung at periods right through the whole mass, which means that the choirmembers have to sit through the whole mass before they can leave their box. Normally this doesn&#8217;t prove to be a problem and the other choristers are rarely inconvenienced by this arrangement, even though the masses can sometimes run for 3 hours or more on holidays or festivals. However, this poor Irish lass doesn&#8217;t have the fortitude of her fellow choirmembers and this has caused her to become quite nervous and fidgetty at times.<br />
From experience of being a parishioner in the church for over 5 years, I know that she is the only one of the 64 choristers to have shown a regular tendancy towards having the urge to use the toilet before the end of the mass and even though her bladder would be considered normal under other circumstances, I have seen her in a state of heightened desperation several times at the end of a long mass.<br />
The most memorable time was during the Mass of St. Patrick (March 17) himself, when the choir had made their way around the back for the pulpit from their box and formed an arc as each chorister took up their position on the platform. This darling, Marie Rourke, was one of the first to take her position and looked luscious in her one–piece choral gown. She was 18 and 5&#8217;4 foot tall, looked magnificent as her long flowing black hair alighted on her shoulders, covering the material of her gown. Her long dark, sleek porcelain–skinned feet peeked out beneath her gown. After Marie had been standing on the platform for almost an hour after the mass had already been going on for 3 1/3 hours, the things suddenly took a very bad turn for her.<br />
Several in the congregation (including me) noticed that Marie appeared to be under some strain. She had taken the normal pose, as all the other choristers did, with her long legs next to each other, knees slightly bent and with her hands by her side. But after 20 minutes, she appeared to be shaking and biting on her lower lip from time to time. She began to press her upper thighs tightly together beneath her gown in an unnatural movement. I saw Marie move her left hand toward her navel. She rested the base of her hand on the top of her thigh as she pressed down with her fingers into the soft gown material. Marie continued to press her fingers into her navel for several minutes. Nobody else seemed to notice what she was doing and that it was apparent that she had to pee very badly.<br />
Over the next several minutes later, Marie began to get panicky and I could see that she was dying to have a really urgent pee, because she had her feet crossed and her face was going red. Suddenly, she looked towards the door to the baptistry and began inching away from the rest of the choir, walking in an erratic fashion toward the side of the platform. This was when it happened. Marie started peeing in her gown, as she broke into a run toward the baptistry door. It became obvious to the congregation, and the priests, that pee was running down both her legs and dripping onto the carpet in a torrent. A stream of her pee could be seen running over her shoes and splashing onto the carpet. The crotch of her white gown became a very dark gray, as she disappeared into the baptistry with one hand wedged in her groin.<br />
Marie was given a stern lecture afterwards by the Monsignor in charge of the choir and ordered to clean up the platform before spending 2 hours praying for forgiveness. The Deacons stated that choristers must have good bladder control in order to belong to the choir. Soiling of their clothing was not permitted. Marie was devastated, as she was embarrassed infront of the congregation and taken out of the choir for a month. <br />
One of the other female choristers (in her 20s) told to me later that she sometimes also was dying to pee during some masses, but made me promise that no one else would ever hear about her little secret. This girl, Beth, said that she knows of several incidents where she had to wet her panties because the pressure was too much. She also said that another chorister had once given her laxatives during the trials for the choir to make her uncomfortable on stage. This happened to her when she was 16 and had a sudden urgent need to poo during the main hymn. The urge became greater and greater until she no longer could control herself. She eventually had to carefully poop her panties and cross her legs. Luckily for her, her poo stayed in her panties and left no stain on the back of her gown. No–one noticed. Once backstage, she quickly removed her dirty panties and shorts, discarding them so she did not stink of poo for the rest of the trials. She is sure that she was deliberately slipped a laxative because she has never had to poo so badly, so quickly.<br />
Followup to this account: After this incident, Marie was eventually allowed to join the choir again, though the Monsignor kept a sharp eye on her for weeks afterwards and would cast a stern look at her if she so much as hinted at needing to go to the toilet, which happened more than once over that period, but her fear of the wrath of the Monsignor seemed to be enough to prevent anymore emergencies.<br />
