                <p>This story is one of my fantasies (based on some fact) but is not meant to be in any way disrespectful to the very real problem of bullying in schools.<br />
Making my way to the ladies&#8217; room I saw them, three girls standing in the hall, their uniforms the same as mine, but that&#8217;s where the similarity ended. My name is Mary. I attended my local school, but even at 18 I was still being bullied– by Heather and her two cronies.<br />
I had refused to give them any money or CDs and they wanted to push me. Heather called me over and I went timidly pulling my blazer over my dark blue pleated skirt (ballerina length) and white blouse.<br />
Suddenly I had a thought. Anything is better than the insults and pain so I increased my leg movements and said in a nervous voice &#8220;I&#8217;m really sorry Heather, I&#8217;ll pay next time.&#8221; She glared at me, her lovely cold eyes taking me in. &#8220;Can&#8217;t we do this later, I want to go in there, we have algebra.&#8221;<br />
Heather was about to allow me through when June said, &#8220;She&#8217;s a senior, Heather. Remember that Prefect that almost made you pee your panties last year?&#8221; Heather flushed and then seemed to notice my discomfort. &#8220;I think we would be remiss in hurting you Mary, let&#8217;s get on. Hurry, you don&#8217;t want to be late!&#8221; She guided me from the ladies&#8217; room. I stammered and said, &#8220;It&#8217;s double algebra, and I need to go before class!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Quiet!&#8221; she snapped. &#8220;You will hold it until I say, or would you rather be hurt?&#8221; I looked downcast but inside I was smiling. The only down side was that I really did have to go.<br />
Heather held me across the shoulders as we walked; her hair smelled of pine trees, then she broke contact at the door to the class, but gently. I took my seat, aware of my need while crossing my legs and taking the chance to lean forward when smoothing my skirt. A double period of algebra meant two sessions of 40 minutes. This was going to be uncomfortable but I have been desperate before– like what girl hasn&#8217;t?<br />
Time passed while Claire and June giggled as my leg crossing became more pronounced. The nervous tension of the situation was taking a toll and I was getting antsy. That was how I spent the first period, fidgeting and trying to work. Finally the bell rang and Miss Campbell said, &#8220;Ok, anyone who wants to go to the toilet can go now, but be back in five minutes.&#8221; I let my hands fall into my lap and pushed down as I got up.<br />
Heather caught my eye and she simply glanced at my chair. I arranged my skirt and retook my seat, slowly crossing my legs and chewing my lip. No acting now, I really needed to go to the bathroom. Claire and June giggled and said under their breath, &#8220;Does baby need to leave the room? Please Miss, can I be excused?&#8221; They were horrible, but Heather moved her lovely red hair and gave me a look of sympathy, I thought.<br />
The next 20 minutes were agony. I squirmed and danced trying not to let anyone know I was nearly wetting myself since I was afraid to go to the ladies&#8217;. After another few minutes with my hand pressed into my lap I had to ask. I went to raise my hand. Heather glared at me but with a half smile and I lowered my tentative hand.<br />
I tried to wait some more but started to get very scared, I&#8217;m 18, I can&#8217;t just pee in my uniform. Looking at Heather, she just shrugged. Raising my hand I asked to leave the room, thankfully the teacher said yes. Heather, quick as a flash said, &#8220;Me too, miss&#8221; and followed. In the corridor, Heather lead me to the stairs. &#8220;What about the ones on this floor?&#8221; I blurted out, by now I was crossing my legs every few feet.<br />
Heather put her arm around me and we sat on a bench, as there were a number of these littered around the school dedicated to this and that. I found myself leaning into her. We sat for a minute or so with me leaning against Heather while my squirming turned into a rigid gentle rocking. Finally she said &#8220;come on and lead me to the ladies,&#8221; which were thankfully on the same floor and she stopped just inside the door. Moving from foot to foot I said, &#8220;Please heather I&#8217;m going to&#8230;&#8221; She looked sad and stepped back. I stopped left hand pressing hard between my legs through my skirt. She was looking at the floor, her eyes hooded by her full lashes. Shivering with need I went over to her. &#8220;What?&#8221; I said. &#8220;You let me hug you!&#8221; I smiled and curtsied. She took my hand and said, &#8220;Go to the toilet, then go home, I&#8217;ll tell the others that you got wet.&#8221; I made to go to the cubical but turned around. &#8220;Heather,&#8221; she looked up and I came forward and kissed her. She fell back a few feet with her hand pressing between her legs as she needed to go a bit too, &#8220;what are you&#8230;&#8221;<br />
I leant on the sink and held myself again. Heather recovered and grabbed me and kissed me hard as hard as Peter White had at the school dance. I was smiling when she stopped and I said &#8220;this in the most wonderful thing that ever happened to me, but I really must pee now!&#8221;<br />
It was at this point when June came in. Thinking quickly I said, &#8220;Pretend to tickle me!&#8221; Heather recovered quickly and put her hands to my sides, &#8220;no hurting, just tickling, how bad is that?&#8221; she growled.<br />
June came forward and took over. She was not kidding as Heather had been, so I begged her to stop and crouched on the floor crying. I could not hold it any longer (I was almost dribbling back when I was talking to Heather) and broke free, making for the cubical. Suddenly I started to go. Not just dribbles and spurts but full on. I just froze, hand on my crouch, piss pouring down my legs through my clothes. Strangely the only thing I could see was Heather now had started fidgeting her legs in the way I had about a half hour before. I was soaked and dripping. The teacher was called and I was lead in shame to the school nurse. They sent someone to take me home– it was Heather. She smiled and moved from foot to foot.<br />
&#8220;I have to take you home,&#8221; she said. Heather&#8217;s skirt was shorter cut than mine and it was clear she had not yet gotten to pee since my accident some 30 minutes ago. &#8220;So, come on, the bus is due!&#8221;<br />
The bus was 10 minutes late. Heather never went to the loo until she got to my place, sort of&#8230;<br />
