                <p>I&#8217;m not quite sure why I&#8217;m telling you this story; I guess if someone enjoys it I&#8217;ll feel a bit happier about what happened.<br />
So here goes&#8230;.<br />
I&#8217;m Katy, I live in Cornwall, I&#8217;m about five and a half feet tall with shoulder length dark hair, and people often say I look a bit like Posh Spice.<br />
I turned 19 a couple of weeks ago and as an extra special treat for my birthday my mum took me to New York on a shopping spree (I&#8217;m so spoilt!!)<br />
On the morning of the trip I had a couple of coffees and a bowl of cornflakes with lots of milk –yum!<br />
We set off in good time to get to Heathrow, I was sipping my water bottle as we made our way up the M4 when suddenly near the Chippenham junction the traffic ground to a halt, it looked like there was an accident ahead, we were crawling along and I needed a wee.<br />
&#8220;Mum can we stop at the services, I need the loo?&#8221; &#8220;No problem Katy the next services are at Membury, its only about 30 miles away.&#8221;<br />
Well, it took nearly an hour to get to those services. &#8220;Katy it&#8217;s another hour till Heathrow, if we stop we might miss check in&#8221; &#8220;Oh okay mum I can wait&#8221;<br />
We finally made it to Heathrow but by the time we got a parking space we had to dash to make check in, we did with about 5 minutes to spare, by now I was really looking forward to a wee.<br />
&#8220; I&#8217;m just off to the ladies&#8217; mum.&#8221; &#8220;I think we should clear customs first, there&#8217;s a long line at security.&#8221;<br />
Mum wasn&#8217;t joking. It took ages to clear customs and by the time we got through I was dying for a wee and was trying to hold myself subtly by putting my hand in my jeans pocket.<br />
&#8220;We need to get to the gate urgently, Katy!&#8221; &#8220;Mum, I&#8217;m bursting. I need a wee first.&#8221; &#8220;We need to get to the gate, they will have a loo there.&#8221;<br />
We got to the boarding gate just as they were starting to board the plane.<br />
&#8220;Mum, I need a wee desperately,&#8221; I whispered urgently, trying to hold on without squirming.<br />
&#8220;You will have to wait until we are on the plane!&#8221; &#8220;Mum, I&#8217;m busting. I can&#8217;t wait that long&#8230;&#8221; &#8220;Well, you&#8217;ll just have to. There&#8217;s nowhere else.&#8221; &#8220;Oh God. I can&#8217;t hold it. I can&#8217;t! I have to pee right now!&#8221;<br />
Oh God, was I desperate!! So close to wetting myself I was almost in tears. I was &#8216;holding on&#8217; with all my strength and it felt as if I was right on the brink of wetting myself. <br />
We got to the plane and started climbing the stairs to board but in my predicament I missed my step and stumbled.<br />
&#8220;Oh no. Oh no please God, nooooo&#8230;&#8221; I slammed my hands into my crotch but it was no good, my hands were getting wet– warm and wet. I froze in shock, staring through my tears as a dark wet patch expanded around the crotch of my pale blue jeans, spreading rapidly up my bottom and over my inner thighs. The dark area spread down my legs as I stood there and wet myself, pee collecting in my timberland boots and dripping down the steps behind me.<br />
&#8220;Oh for f*** sake Katherine I can&#8217;t believe you did that, now what are we going to do, you stupid girl?&#8221; I just stood at the door to the plane with my Miss Sixty jeans still dripping wee.<br />
An airhostess appeared and took me to one side.<br />
&#8220;Uh miss have you been drinking, I can&#8217;t let you fly if you are drunk.&#8221; &#8220;She&#8217;s not drunk, she just wet herself like a stupid baby,&#8221; my mum snapped. &#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t allow you to sit on our seats in that state, do you have anything to change in to?&#8221; &#8220;All my clothes are in the hold luggage.&#8221; &#8220;She&#8217;s 19– I didn&#8217;t expect to have to bring a change of knickers for her!&#8221; &#8220;Shut up mum you aren&#8217;t helping.&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;ll see if I can get some pyjama trousers from the first class sleep packs.&#8221;<br />
The stewardess promptly returned with the pyjama bottoms and a plastic bag for my wet jeans and knickers, I went to the loo to change and poured about a pint of pee out of my boots.<br />
I made my way timidly to my seat having just gone through the most embarrassing moment in my entire life.<br />
