                <p>It is my pleasure to share this experience with you. It&#8217;s one that I wish I could live over and over again.<br />
A couple of months back I was joining one of my neighbors in celebrating her birthday. She had planned to have a limo take a bunch of us into the city to go to a club. Sounded fine to me. It was a horrible night out weather wise though. It had been pouring rain since early in the afternoon and showed no signs of slowing. <br />
The bunch of us included two other guys, five girls, all of who were very attractive, I must say, and myself. So off we headed, the city was about half an hour from our apartments. The drive on this night was taking a bit longer due to the heavy rain. On our way there I noticed some of the girls whispering about how badly they had to pee. We were still about 15 minutes from the club and I was also noticing my own need to pee. We had been drinking for an hour or so beforehand and I hadn&#8217;t gone to the bathroom yet. The beers were starting to take their toll, but at least it wasn&#8217;t just on me. Two of the girls seemed desperate to go as well. <br />
Another ten minutes passed as we continued our conversations. I was doing my best to concentrate on a conversation with my neighbor Casey in order to draw my attention away from the need to pee. As we got into the city we hit a bit of traffic to further slow things down. For the couple of minutes before that I had been keeping my eye on Kendra who was sitting directly opposite of me and had gotten a bit quiet over the past couple of minutes. She had crossed her legs tightly and was leaning forward with her arms folded across her waist. When she noticed the heavy traffic she got a worried look on her face. I knew she must be getting very desperate. <br />
We finally got to about half a block away from the club. Kendra was squirming constantly with her arms still folded across her waist. She asked if we could get out right here with a hint of desperation. It was still raining out so Casey told Kendra to hold on another second till we got right in front of the club to hop out. Kendra was really looking worried. A minute later we finally got there and Kendra was the first out of the door urging us to hurry along. She rushed right to the door and paid her cover and dashed in. I was in a hurry because I, too, had to go bad. I made it in not too far behind her but I couldn&#8217;t find her. Forget that, I was about to have an accident myself. I quickly rushed to the men&#8217;s room where I was able to whip out my cock just in time before I started squirting into my pants. Thank God. I was so disappointed I didn&#8217;t get to see Kendra fight to get to the bathroom. When I got back out I saw her already at the bar with the girls. I checked her pants out and they showed no signs of dampness. Damn&#8230;she had made it. <br />
Now–fast forward to about 3 A.M. for the ride home. <br />
We had all been drinking a lot while celebrating Casey&#8217;s birthday and now it was time to go. I made sure I used the bathroom before we left so I wouldn&#8217;t have to worry again about my own urge on the way home. The two other guys had already left with one of the girls, so that just left me with Casey, Kendra, Erin, and Kathy for the ride home. Towards the end of the night I had been keeping my eye on the girls to see who had been using the bathroom and none of the girls, except Erin, had used the bathroom in the last hour at least. I spotted the limo outside and reminded the girls the limo driver would leave if we weren&#8217;t there at 3 A.M. sharp. It was about 2:57&#8230; perfect timing. I urged to girls to pay their tabs, which they did, and we were off. <br />
We all hopped into the limo and I was sure that someone would get desperate on the way home. I got more than I hoped for. <br />
We had all been drinking beer pretty heavily through the night, mixed in with some shots of liquor. I was just waiting for the beers to do their work. <br />
Through the first fifteen minutes no one showed any signs of a need to pee. Then Casey, who was again sitting next to me, broke the ice. She turned to me and asked me how far we were from home. I took a look at the road and told her about twenty minutes. &#8220;Fuck&#8230;. I hope we get there fast, because I really gotta go&#8221;, she whispered. Now this really got me turned on. I had been hoping to see Casey get desperate the most of all the girls. She was so hot– about 5&#8217;5&#8221;, blonde hair and just a perfect body. I mean perfect. She was wearing a tight white button down top with tight black pants. She had taken her purse and put it over her crotch with one hand underneath, I&#8217;m sure she was squeezing herself. This was making me hard. <br />
Not a couple minutes later the other girls were laughing and carrying on when Kathy stopped laughing and quickly crossed her legs tightly. Her laughter stopped with it and now she began to look worried. Could she be getting desperate also? I got my answer when she turned to Kendra and I heard her mention how bad she needed to pee. Kendra told her to shut up and not talk about it, it was making her want to go as well. <br />
Meanwhile Casey had gone pretty quiet. I asked her if she was OK, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m fine I guess. We had just better get home soon, I&#8217;m totally bursting.&#8221; These words alone almost made me cum in my pants. I was going to sit back and enjoy the last ten minutes of this ride. <br />
A couple of minutes later Casey was getting restless. She was constantly shifting in her seat. I know that the other girls noticed, but they didn&#8217;t say anything, they were struggling themselves. The rain outside had to be making it horrible. It was pouring down on the top of the limo. The sound of rain can make a fight to hold it unbearable. I loved the sound of every drop. <br />
About two minutes to go and Casey was now holding herself with both hands. She was taking deep breaths through her teeth and moaning things to herself. I kept trying to assure her she would be fine, although I was hoping for the opposite. <br />
When we got to about a couple blocks away Kendra leaned forward and asked Casey if she could have her keys. She explained that she had to go so bad that she wanted to run in and be the first one to use the bathroom. Reluctantly Casey got out her keys and gave them to Kendra. I heard Kathy mention to Kendra that she had better make it quick because she had to go just as bad. What a situation– three girls on the brink of wetting themselves and just one bathroom. I assured myself I was going to see one of them have an accident, and hopefully it was going to be Casey. <br />
As the limo pulled up both Kendra and Kathy went first out of the door and ran towards the apartment, with Erin right behind them. I don&#8217;t know if she had gotten desperate too or just didn&#8217;t want to get wet from the rain. Whatever it was I didn&#8217;t want to miss it. I quickly paid the driver and turned to Casey, &#8220;Alright Case, we made it. Let&#8217;s go.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Mikey hold on a sec&#8230;&#8221; She was grabbing herself tightly. &#8220;God, I feel that if I move that I&#8217;ll lose it.&#8221; <br />
&#8220;Come on, I&#8217;m here with you. We&#8217;ll make it,&#8221; I said.<br />
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I can wait until Kendra and Kathy to get out of the bathroom though.&#8221; She was almost crying, tears in her eyes. <br />
&#8220;Well, how about we make a dash to my apartment. You can go there without having a wait,&#8221; I said.<br />
She agreed and after a couple of more squeezes she got up and got out of the limo. Not more than five steps she quickly stopped and bent over, squeezing herself with both hands. I grabbed her arm and said, &#8220;Come on Case, your almost there.&#8221; She began walking again, without unlocking her knees. She was holding on with all she had. The rain was still pouring down. We got about 20 steps from my door when it happened and she couldn&#8217;t hold it any longer. <br />
Tears rolling down her face she froze, &#8220;Shit!!&#8230;Shit!!&#8230; God no!!! Nooo!!!!&#8221; She turned from me and reached around with her hand and grabbed her ass. I watched in awe as the pee slowly began to trickle down her left leg. She tried squeezing her legs together as tight as she could but she couldn&#8217;t stop it. The piss began to hiss against the crouch of her pants. She finally put both hands up on the wall; bent over, spread her legs and just let go. She sighed loudly at the relief she must have felt. She peed hard for over a minute. All the beers had finally made their way out. Both legs were totally soaked, a huge puddle at her feet. <br />
When she finished she turned to me with a face full of tears. &#8220;It&#8217;s okay Case&#8230;let&#8217;s get you inside and dried off. You can change into something in my place, the other girls don&#8217;t have to know.&#8221; Although I bet they had a struggle of their own. <br />
I got Casey into a pair of old sweats. The other girls called over to see what was up. I explained it was nothing and that we would be right over. When Casey showed back up at her place wearing my sweats the other girls knew. But to Casey&#8217;s surprise Kathy came out of her room and told her not to worry and that she had had an accident herself. The two hugged and laughed at each other. No big deal. <br />
I would have loved to see Kathy lose it as well. But for now I&#8217;ll have to savor the image of Casey wetting her pants. Hopefully more stories to come! <br />
