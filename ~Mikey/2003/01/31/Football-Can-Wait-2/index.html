                <p>So let&#8217;s continue our adventure at the football game. We had a good time while at the game. You can&#8217;t buy beer at the college games, of course, so we quenched our thirst with cokes and water.<br />
During halftime we all took a trip to the bathroom. While on our way Kendra grabbed my arm and whispered in my ear, &#8220;Mikey&#8230; how good was that earlier? I know I didn&#8217;t wet myself like I promised but it felt so good trying to hold it. I just couldn&#8217;t wet myself in front of all those people. Sorry, I hope you aren&#8217;t disappointed&#8230;&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Hey Kendra, that was pretty hot that all three of you had to go, especially Stacia. I really thought she wouldn&#8217;t make it,&#8221; I replied.<br />
&#8220;I know, I thought so too. It was a pretty close call for both of us. God it felt so good to let it go in my panties. I love that feeling. I liked that you guys were watching me get desperate too,&#8221; Kendra said with a smile.<br />
We stayed for pretty much the whole game and then got on our way. We got back to the parking garage and realized it would take quite a while to get out. Cars were lined up all the way to the top deck to get out. When we got to the car Kendra suggested we just hang out for like 15 minutes or so and let the traffic clear a bit. I knew the traffic would last for maybe the next hour or so without letting up, but I think I must have known that Kendra was trying to get the girls into a desperate situation again.<br />
So we popped the tailgate down again and the girls poured some wine, which had stayed on ice the whole time. I thought about it and figured out that the girls nor myself had used the restroom since halftime, about an hour and a half ago. We had all been drinking the cokes and water pretty steadily too. I really didn&#8217;t feel the need to go, but maybe I would see some more desperation yet. I opened some beers with the girls and we began talking some more. About a half hour passed and Robyn suggested that we get on our way, as she had to get back for something later that night. I kind of stalled a bit and we joined traffic about 25 minutes later.<br />
Traffic hadn&#8217;t let up at all and was actually pretty thick. All the cars were heading for the same interstate that we were. Sure enough, as it has happened to me many times before, I began to feel a need to pee. Sometimes it just pops up on you, and that it did. We were sitting in heavy traffic and I was thinking maybe a half hour until we would get back to Kendra&#8217;s. The girls were all chatting away and it seemed that we were hardly moving.<br />
Another fifteen minutes passed before the girls began to hint about the need to find a restroom. It was Stacia again, &#8220;Kendra&#8230;I hate this, but I need to pee again.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Oh girl, me too&#8230; Mikey what&#8217;s going on with this traffic?&#8221; Kendra asked.<br />
I told them both that it would probably be another fifteen minutes of bumper to bumper. They both felt good about holding it this time. On the other hand, I was feeling more of a need to pee now than before. Fast forward another ten minutes and we were close to the end of the traffic back up. I really needed to go by now. Once we broke out of it and got onto the freeway the girls sounded a bit relieved, but were still urging me to make it home as soon as possible. I assured them I would, as I had to go just like they did. Robyn really never showed any desperation, I guess she is better at holding it than all of us.<br />
I sped through the freeway in like ten minutes. When I exited the freeway, Kendra and Stacia, the girls in the back, began to sound as desperate as before. I was just about bursting as well, as hearing them talk was making me want to go even more.<br />
Five minutes later we got to Kendra&#8217;s. Robyn had said she was going right to her car to take off, as she was already late to meet someone. That left the three of us to battle for the restroom. I was totally about to lose it myself, but I knew I would have to hold it until the girls had gone. We all rushed up to Kendra&#8217;s place and Stacia was pleading her case to use the bathroom first. Kendra was doing an equally good job pleading how desperate she was. Regardless, when we got in Stacia dashed for the bathroom and promised to be quick. She shut the door leaving Kendra and I grabbing our crotches. Kendra&#8217;s huge nipples were erect and poking through her skintight shirt; it was hot.<br />
I told Kendra I couldn&#8217;t wait another second. I opened the door a crack as Stacia began to pee. I told her I was going to jump in the shower and pee in the drain. She mumbled something as I opened the door and walked in. She pulled her shirt over her crotch, not offering me much a view. I drew back the shower curtain, which was clear and jumped in the tub. I didn&#8217;t care what Stacia saw; after all, I have a big cock. I whipped my cock out and didn&#8217;t try to hide it from Stacia either. God it felt so good to let go. I was getting so turned on by the fact that Stacia was watching.<br />
Just then Kendra jumped in the tub behind me, explaining that she couldn&#8217;t wait another second either. I looked over my shoulder as Kendra turned her back to me and ripped down her pants and panties. She squatted and joined me in flooding her shower. I turned back around and closed my eyes as my last squirts dribbled from my cock. I opened my eyes and looked over at Stacia, whom I could tell was shy. She still had her shirt pulled down over her crotch. I know that she had been staring at me as I peed, and I didn&#8217;t mind. I was hoping the whole thing might turn her on. I zipped up just as I heard Kendra&#8217;s flow begin to end. I turned around and watched the last trickles flow from Kendra&#8217;s pussy. She has just the best ass ever; I loved watching all of this. I excused myself as I stepped out of the tub and out of the bathroom.<br />
I was in Kendra&#8217;s kitchen when both girls came out and into the kitchen laughing.<br />
&#8220;Geez Mikey, I thought guys were supposed to be good at holding it?&#8221; Stacia said.<br />
&#8220;Hey, sorry to bust in like that. I was about to fucking piss in my pants. What about you guys? You both have to pee all the time!&#8221; I replied.<br />
&#8220;I know, I know&#8230;God I almost didn&#8217;t make it earlier at the porta–potty on the way to the game. I haven&#8217;t wet myself since I was 13. I never had to go so bad. But you know how it is when you break the seal!&#8221; Stacia said.<br />
&#8220;Girl, tell me about it. My third year at school, I was coming home from a party and didn&#8217;t make it up to my room in time. Total humiliation! Plenty of girls on the second floor saw me flood my jeans as I ran to my door. I will never forget it&#8230;&#8221; Kendra jumped in.<br />
&#8220;Yeah, you guys have it pretty good. You can just whip that thing out anywhere and pee by a tree or something. Us girls aren&#8217;t always so lucky!&#8221; commented Stacia.<br />
Stacia fixed herself a glass of water and headed home. She gave me a big hug and thanked me for taking her along to the game. When we hugged I got to feel those huge tits push up against my chest. God, how I wanted to nail her and Kendra together right then. It was a big day, and I hadn&#8217;t seen any of these girls have an accident, although I did watch them get extremely desperate and then make it just in time.<br />
The image of a woman in true desperation is still the sexiest sight I know of.<br />
