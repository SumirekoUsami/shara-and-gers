                <p>This is a story about my fianc&#8217;, Eric and myself. We both have quite the wetting fetish and although this is a fictional story, similar things have happened to us before. Enjoy!<br />
I knew there would definitely be some wetness that day because the traffic report warned of delays due to road construction on the highway. Before heading out we filled a cooler with bottles of water, cans of coke, and a few bottles of juice and iced tea since it was a rather hot day. Eric and myself are both freaks about staying hydrated and even if we have to go on a long road trip we don&#8217;t hold off on the fluids. It&#8217;s simply uncomfortable to be thirsty, and if it&#8217;s only the two of us on the trip a little moisture never hurt anyone :) I was sure to pee before we left but I didn&#8217;t recall Eric making a potty trip. I never remind him because I figure he is an adult and can take care of himself.<br />
All along the way we laughed and talked and I even gave Eric a little roadâ€“head just for shits and giggles. Between the two of us we probably consumed about 60 oz. of fluid each in the first 3 and a half hours. I started to feel the first hints of pressure in my bladder, but it was nothing I couldn&#8217;t deal with. The heat was hitting me from my side, however, and it was making me a little dizzy, so I lay my head on Eric&#8217;s lap.<br />
He moaned a little bit and I looked up at him. &#8220;Baby? You ok?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Oohhh, yeah I just have to pee.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Awww, sweetie. I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; I scooted my head closer to the steering wheel away from his tummy.<br />
&#8220;Is that better baby?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Mmhmm.&#8221; He smiled at me sweetly. &#8220;How are you doing&#8230;in that respect?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I&#8217;m getting there myself.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Mmmmm, I love you&#8230;&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I love you too sweetie.&#8221; Eric has always had a stronger bladder than myself and can usually hold out much longer than I can.<br />
As the next hour and a half passed, we both each had another drink and I noticed that Eric started squirming around a little. I had to sit up myself because I needed to cross my legs to stay comfortable. I wasn&#8217;t desperate yet, but the need was pronounced enough that it was hard not to think about it. We were driving on a bridge over a lake. &#8220;Oho, the sight of that water is not helping me right now,&#8221; Eric remarked.<br />
&#8220;Aww honey, are you ok?&#8221;<br />
He smiled at me, &#8220;I can wait for a little longer but it&#8217;ll be wanting out pretty soon.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Yeah&#8230;me too.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I can tell sweetie,&#8221; he giggled, &#8220;I noticed you sat up and crossed your legs&#8230; I must say it&#8217;s quite arousing&#8230;&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you like it,&#8221; I giggled, and then stopped giggling because the laughter jarred my bladder.<br />
He took note of my sudden stop in laughter. &#8220;Aww you&#8217;re so cute!&#8221; he said. I blushed. &#8220;I love you,&#8221; we both said in unison. I leaned over to kiss him and the movement hurt my bladder and I moaned. &#8220;Awww honey, are you ok?&#8221; he asked.<br />
&#8220;I&#8217;ll be fine.&#8221; I said. I do have a much weaker bladder than him but I was pretty sure I could hold out a while longer if I put my mind to it.<br />
We agreed to try to wait for a little while longer before we stopped. I knew he wanted me to have an accident and frankly I wanted him to do the same so I was going to hold out and not ask to stop no matter how badly I needed to go. Every ten minutes or so he&#8217;d ask me if I was ok and I&#8217;d say I was fine, although in reality it had started to become quite painful and the need was all I could think about. Even breathing was hard. I could see the pained look in his eyes and really I knew he was asking me if I was okay in the hopes of me saying I was desperate so we could stop and he could go pee, but I really wanted to see him have an accident&#8230;plus I was keen on the idea of wetting myself as well, so I held out.<br />
Another hour passed and I could tell that he was getting pretty desperate, more so than me. &#8220;Baby, are you gonna be ok?&#8221; I asked.<br />
He sighed. &#8220;It&#8217;s getting really bad. It hurts.&#8221; I removed my seatbelt and moved to the middle. I put my hand down without applying any pressure onto his tummy and he groaned and winced in pain.<br />
&#8220;I can&#8217;t concentrate, baby,&#8221; he moaned, &#8220;you mind if we switch at the next light?&#8221; I felt bad that it was hurting him so much. I was hoping for an accident but I could tell my baby was in pain&#8230;&#8220;oowwww!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;oohh I can&#8217;t breathe I have to pee so bad!&#8221; a tear came down from his eye and I kissed him.<br />
&#8220;We can stop at the next exit baby,&#8221; I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m in a pretty bad way myself. Don&#8217;t cry sweetie, it&#8217;ll be okay.&#8221; I wondered why he was crying. Usually he liked having an accident. He had to have been in a lot of pain. &#8220;Honey did you pee before we left?&#8221; I asked.<br />
&#8220;Ooh, no I didn&#8217;t&#8230;I had to go when we left, in fact,&#8221; he whimpered and cried, &#8220;Ooh god it hurts soooo bad!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Aw my poor baby,&#8221; I said. &#8220;How long has it been?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;About 8 hours probably&#8230;&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Ooh sweetie, no wonder!&#8221;<br />
He didn&#8217;t say anything. Eric got a sinking feeling when we pulled up to a traffic jam. &#8220;Oh no!&#8221; he wailed, &#8220;a traffic jam! Honey there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m gonna make it through this&#8230;I just have to pee too bad!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Aw my sweetie&#8230; I know it hurts.&#8221; He whimpered and cried some more and I scooted close to him and held him, kissed him, and reassured him that if he had an accident it would not bother me. &#8220;Baby I gotta pee really bad too. I&#8217;m not gonna hold out much longer, either.&#8221;<br />
With that I unzipped his jeans and pulled him out and started massaging and rubbing, groans of pain coming from him as I did. I instructed him to lean his chair back. &#8220;It&#8217;ll make you a little more comfy.&#8221; he abided. I pulled up his shirt and started to gently stroke his tummy, which made him squirm more. &#8220;Shhhh, just relax baby, it&#8217;s okay,&#8221; I cooed. I reached back to grab a thick towel I had in the back seat. I lay his dick on top of the towel in his lap to protect his jeans. The traffic was backed up for miles and I knew we wouldn&#8217;t be moving for at least a half hour, if not more.<br />
Tears were still falling from his eyes because of the pain. I wondered why he was holding back still. I decided that if he weren&#8217;t going to pee voluntarily, I would bring it out of him. I continued to massage his swollen tummy, gradually increasing the pressure each time.<br />
&#8220;Ohhhowwww!&#8221; he cried as I increased the pressure.<br />
&#8220;Shh, baby it&#8217;s ok. Just relax and let it go. Why suffer like this?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I&#8217;m trying&#8230;ouch!! I want to but I think I&#8217;ve held it too long and I can&#8217;t,&#8221; he wailed.<br />
&#8220;My poor baby&#8230;just try to relax and pee.&#8221; I stroked his hair and caressed his cheek and kissed him. I told him to visualize waterfalls and running faucets and rivers and rain&#8230;he closed his eyes and took deep breaths and tried to relax. I could tell he was trying to let go but couldn&#8217;t. <br />
He grunted and gritted his teeth and tried to force it out, but nothing happened. &#8220;Oooowwww!!! I can&#8217;t pee! This hurts sooo much!!! Ow, he started to sob and cry out loud from the pain.<br />
&#8220;Baby, don&#8217;t strain, that&#8217;ll just make it harder,&#8221; I said, &#8220;just relax baby&#8230;I&#8217;ll try to help you, okay?&#8221; He nodded, but tried one more time to force it out. I could tell he was so frustrated that he just wanted to get it out. He tensed up and pushed down on his bladder and stroked his penis but nothing happened. He cried and cried&#8230;<br />
&#8220;Baby that&#8217;s not gonna help. Just breathe and hold my hand&#8230;I&#8217;ll help you. We&#8217;ll get it out. It&#8217;s gonna be okay sweetheart, I love you&#8230;&#8221;<br />
Iwas determined to get him to peeâ€“ still massaging his swollen tummy; I reached into the cooler and made a big deal out of swishing around the ice. He whimpered as I made the dramatic water sounds and pulled out a bottle of water. I swished the bottle around in front of him. I opened it up and took a mouthful into me. I moved my head down to his cock and let the water dribble out of my mouth onto it slowly. &#8220;Oooooohhh, I gotta pee so bad!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;aahoooww,&#8221; he sobbed, tears pouring out of him in an endless stream. It broke my heart and I wanted to make him pee right away. I set the cold water bottle down right on his distended bladder and he squirmed under it and moaned. I massaged his belly with it and applied lots of pressure but after a few minutes of this, nothing happened.<br />
Then I did what I hoped would be the solution. I climbed up onto him and sat directly down right on his bladder putting all my weight on it. He winced and wailed, &#8220;Ooooowwww that hurts!!!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I know babyâ€“ I&#8217;m sorry but I&#8217;m trying to make you pee&#8230;bear with me.&#8221; I bent over and kissed him. &#8220;I love you angel.&#8221;<br />
Between sobs he got out &#8220;I love you too&#8230;thank you.&#8221; Then I started to bounce my butt up and down and I pushed my hands as hard as I could into his poor bladder and he cried out.<br />
&#8220;I need to peeeeeeeeee,&#8221; he cried, and just as he said it, his eyes closed and he sighed and groaned almost orgasmically.<br />
&#8220;Aah thank God!&#8221; he breathed in a loud whisper, still crying. Finally he was able to let his floodgates open and relieve himself.<br />
I got up, looked down, and noticed a nice flood coming from my lover&#8217;s penis. I guided the stream onto the thick towel and watched in awe as Eric drained and soaked the towel. He was moaning and groaning and crying and had no control over his body. I reached over and leaned his seat back up for him and I kissed him and nuzzled him as I watched his stream flood the towel and the floorboard. He was trembling and convulsing almost in orgasm along with blissful relief while tears streamed down his face. I kissed him and held his hand and his penis to keep the stream guided. Watching him pee reminded me of my own urgent need and I crossed my legs tightly to keep my floodgates closed. He peed for three minutes straightâ€“ (I shit you not!) he had been holding it for over eight hours and now he finally got to let it all go.<br />
When his flood finally died down, the towel was soaked and dripping wet. I grabbed a plastic shopping bag from the glove box and stashed the towel away in it. There was also a huge puddle in the floorboard but surprisingly only a couple of drops reached his pants. I bent down and kissed his penis, patted it dry with a napkin from the glove box, kissed it again, and put it back in his jeans and patted his crotch lovingly. I looked up at my sweetie and he smiled at me. &#8220;Thank you so much for helping me sweetie,&#8221; he said. We kissed for a minute or so. I asked him if he felt better.<br />
&#8220;Oh my God! Soo much,&#8221; he breathed&#8230;I wiped his tears away with another napkin.<br />
&#8220;Are you okay, angel?&#8221; I asked, &#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen you cry from having to pee before. It had to hurt so bad!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Oohhh it did&#8230;my bladder&#8217;s still aching a little, but I feel so much better and letting it go almost made me come! It felt so good!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Just don&#8217;t ever hold it that long again&#8230;it&#8217;s bad for you, baby.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I know&#8230;sometimes I&#8217;m just absent minded. I forgot to go when we left and I realized it after we hit the road. I would&#8217;ve flooded my pants over an hour ago but I just couldn&#8217;t relax for some reason&#8230;until you got it out of me&#8230;&#8221; he smiled and leaned over to kiss me. &#8220;Speaking of whichâ€“ are <span class="caps">YOU</span> okay? You&#8217;ve been holding on for quite some time yourself.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Yeah I&#8217;m starting to hurt pretty bad,&#8221; I said. I had been so busy taking care of Eric that I momentarily forgot about my own desperate need&#8230;and the desperation was increasing by the second. It was even hard to breathe without every breath causing my bladder to surge with pain.<br />
&#8220;Aw poor sweetie,&#8221; he cooed, &#8220;we&#8217;ll take care of that,&#8221; he smiled. I had my legs crossed and Eric leaned over and we kissed for a long time. Then he sat right next to me and pried my legs apart really far. I knew I wasn&#8217;t going to be able to hold out for longer than a couple more minutes if my legs were this far apart.<br />
Then he did something I totally didn&#8217;t expect! He lifted my skirt and pulled my panties to the side and started lapping and licking wildly.<br />
This always drives me nuts and makes me lose control of my entire body and it was only a matter of seconds before my floodgates were open and I was gushing all over the place, into Eric&#8217;s mouth, in his hair, onto the windshield. I cried out in orgasm from an overload of sensation&#8230;peeing felt so orgasmically good and Eric pleasuring me orally made me come over and over again&#8230;I peed for at least a minute and a half and it felt soooooo good. My panties and skirt remained surprisingly dry. There was a blanket in the back seat and he used it to mop up the pee that was in the floorboards and on the windshield. In total bliss and ecstasy we held each other close and breathed, &#8220;I love you&#8221; over and over again until the traffic started up once more. We had been in traffic for about 45 minutes by the time we finally got out of it. Needless to say, we found a wooded rest area where we could park and make some beautiful love before we continued on our journey&#8230;<br />
