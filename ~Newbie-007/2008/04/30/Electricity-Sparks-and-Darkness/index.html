                <p>True story<br />
I arrived home from work on Friday, relaxed, ate dinner, and pondered what the evening would bring. Little did I know I would arrive home later that evening with hot chills and thinking whether or not my actions were good or bad. Perhaps even feeling a bit guilty&#8230;<br />
Shortly after dinner my uncle, who lives down the road arrived down with a confused and pissed off look on his face. I knew he wanted something – why else would he be here, I thought. He explained the light fitting in his bathroom went, and the wires were melted. I wasn&#8217;t really thinking anything at this stage, just annoyed that my peaceful evening was cut short. His fianc&#8217;e was there, a petite woman in her early 30&#8217;s. She was pretty. She was just in from work, and was downstairs getting ready for her walk. I noticed a litre bottle of water in her hands, but thought nothing of it.<br />
Anyway, she left and up I went to the black light fitting, I started work and in the middle of mundane conversation John said he had to slip away to train his soccer team, but said Mary would be back soon. It wasn&#8217;t a problem I said, and I&#8217;d let myself out otherwise.<br />
A while passed and I was just finished running new wires when I heard a door close and loud footsteps running up the stairs. For a second I wondered who it was and what did they want, and then it hit me all at once. Hit me like a sledgehammer more like. I said hi. Mary was startled to find me in the bathroom, on a ladder working away.<br />
&#8220;You nearly done Joe?&#8221; she said.<br />
&#8220;Few mins,&#8221; I replied casually.<br />
&#8220;Ok, well let me know when you&#8217;re done, I&#8217;ll put tea on&#8221; she said.<br />
She left, and I thought maybe she didn&#8217;t want to tell me. Was she shy– or just embarrassed? I dismissed those thoughts and ripped the fitting from the ceiling, left my tools on the toilet seat and had the small ladder in such a way to slow her down, in case I wasn&#8217;t fast enough. I slowly went down stairs to turn on the power to the lights, daylight was fading but she didn&#8217;t notice them come on. I could hear footsteps in the kitchen, pacing up and down, with the TV on low. I heard a little yelp and the footsteps came closer. I went upstairs and climbed the ladder. She ran up the stairs again and walked into the bathroom. I peered through the hole in the ceiling. I was feeling guilty, but shook it off. She had one hand in her pocket, but it was between her legs. She was also rubbing her thighs together and kept kneeling down. She called out to me. I didn&#8217;t answer; I was hiding and watching. Not a thing on earth was going to stop this. She did a pee pee dance, I was sorry after I didn&#8217;t record it. She regained her composure and moved the ladder and I thought this fun would end soon.<br />
I had a brainwave. I touched the 2 wires together, creating a short, a bang and darkness. She yelped again and asked what the matter was. I lied and said another part of the wire was damaged. She said she needed to use the loo. I asked her to give me 5 minutes. She retreated down stairs and I heard the back door opening. I looked out the bathroom window to see her frantically jumping up and down the holding herself in the back garden. She acted as though she was getting some air, but she was really either going to pee herself or squat in a corner somewhere. I reset the trip switch and while half looking at her I put up the fitting, it took about 5 minutes. It seemed like an eternity as she bobbed around the garden. I had everything finished and for the next few minutes just kept looking at her pee dancing until she stopped. I could hear her groan in agony and slowly she walked back to the house. Both hands were on her crotch.<br />
I prepared myself. I had tools everywhere in the bathroom. I could hear her slowly coming up the stairs. I greeted her. She half jokingly told me not to look, and asked if it was ok to use the bathroom. By the time she reached the landing she couldn&#8217;t move and was sobbing. I cleared the bathroom enough for her to go. She couldn&#8217;t move, and constantly groaning, I offered to lift her, she turned it down. She jokingly again told me not to look and to go downstairs for tea, but I just changed the subject by giving her another suggestion. I even tried telling her the &#8220;it&#8217;s ok to pee yourself, everyone does it&#8221; speech but she shook it off and she inched closer to the bowl. She was crying and desperately rubbing her crotch. She murmured OH NO, and <span class="caps">SHIT</span>. I knew, but pretended not to. She yanked down her tracksuit and through her panties flowed a steady stream of pee as she moved herself onto the bowl. I was out of sight as she turned. Just gathered up tools and cleaned up as she peed. She asked for a towel but I ignored her. I was silent. I heard her move so I did the fake run up the stairs trick. She asked again and I said here and dropped it just inside the door. She picked it up and emerged with the towel on, gave me a hug and said tell no one please. She had her soaking clothes in one hand. I said I wouldn&#8217;t be that cruel as I returned the hug. With tears in her eyes I lifted her spirits by giving her a fireman&#8217;s lift down the stairs. It still remains our little secret. One of many I have&#8230;<br />
