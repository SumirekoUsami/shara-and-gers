            <div class="mt-4">
                <p>Last week I started a waitress job at this club. The first day, my shift started at 8, and they told me to get there by 7:30 because I&#8217;d need to change and fill out a bit of paperwork.<br />
The outfit they gave me was actually quite sexy. Tight tâ€“shirt and a very short miniskirt that only covered half my butt and just barely covered my pussy. They offered me a couple of drinks to loosen my up (on the house of course), which I gladly accepted.<br />
Since it was a night shift there was no lunch break, but I would get 2 paid 15 minute breaks during my shift, which was to end at 5 AM. Things started getting really busy around 10. Around that time I also remember I started to feel a pretty strong urge to pee. It was so busy that I just kept working for a bit and I also didn&#8217;t want to take a break so soon in my shift on my first day. But by 10:30 I getting pretty desperate so I figured I had better go to the toilet. I walked over to the toilet and my boss asked me where I was going. I told him I was taking my first break. &#8220;Not now you can&#8217;t. Look how busy it is! Once things quiet down you can take your breaks.&#8221;<br />
I protested, &#8220;but that won&#8217;t be until the end of the night and I really have to pee.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Look,&#8221; he said, &#8220;this is a good paying job and there are tons of girls who would love to take your place. So if you don&#8217;t want to play by the rules you can leave.&#8221;<br />
There was really nothing I could say to that since I knew it was true. I bit my lip and went over to the bar to get my orders. I was so achingly desperate and I knew there was no way I could wait until after 4 AM to relieve myself. As I carried my orders from the bar I walked with my thighs pressed as tightly as possible against each other.<br />
I kept hobbling around almost dropping a few orders. My urge to pee was getting stronger by the second. I felt as though surges of fluid were pouring into my bladder with no end in sight.<br />
One customer must have noticed my discomfort and asked me if something was wrong. &#8220;No, I&#8230;I&#8217;m F&#8230;Fine&#8221; I replied. I could barely hold in my pee just pressing to come out. &#8220;No,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Something&#8217;s bothering you. What is it?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Well this is really embarrassing, but I have to pee real bad and my boss won&#8217;t let me take a break now because it&#8217;s too busy.&#8221; I told him.<br />
&#8220;Are you wearing any panties under that short skirt?&#8221; he asked me.<br />
I thought that was a bit of a strange question so I asked what he was getting at.<br />
He offered that if I wasn&#8217;t wearing panties, since my skirt was short enough, I could sit on his lap pretending to just be flirting and relieve myself that way. I was not wearing panties and my skirt was definitely short enough that I would be able to pee on his lap without anyone noticing or getting my skirt wet. But I was too shy. &#8220;Thanks, I really appreciate it, but I think my panties would get soaked and that would be no good.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I understand. If you change your mind, I&#8217;ll be here,&#8221; he said.<br />
I smiled and walked away to take an order from someone else. I was so preoccupied with my dire need that I had to ask this girl to repeat her order three times. As I returned from the bar with her order another surge hit me and I could not cringe because I was carrying a tray of drinks. I almost burst out peeing all over. My need was growing fast and I didn&#8217;t know what to do. Should I take up the guy on his offer? I didn&#8217;t see any other options.<br />
I walked back over to this guy, a little embarrassed. &#8220;Um, is your offer still there?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Yep, indeed. Shall we sit down?&#8221; We found a seat and I lifted the back of my skirt and sat on his lap, almost instantly bursting out with a torrent of pee. I must have sat there soaking this poor guy&#8217;s lap for a full five minutes. How grateful I was! &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; I whispered into his ear. I stood up and peeked down at his soaked crotch. Fortunately my skirt was completely dry. My butt and pussy were quite wet, but that would dry soon enough, and wasn&#8217;t noticeable. He walked out of the club looking embarrassed, but I made it through the night because of him. He was my saviour.<br />
At the end of the night my boss told me I had done a good job. I guess I sold enough drinks to make him happy. He said he really liked me and hoped to keep me on for a while. I was happy because the job paid pretty well.<br />
The next night I started to get desperate a couple of hours into my shift again. I looked over and noticed my friend there. Embarrassed, I asked him if he would do the same thing for me he had done the previous night. He happily obliged.<br />
Every night my friend returned, and honestly I never could have made it through the night without him, or at least not without peeing myself in a crowded club and losing my job as a result.<br />
Last night at the end of my shift my supervisor came over to speak to me. He said I&#8217;ve been doing really good work, but he noticed sometimes I flirt with customers for a long time. He said I should never spend more than 30 seconds to a minute flirting because I could be selling drinks. He also said it&#8217;s really inappropriate to sit on a customer&#8217;s lap. I protested that customers were buying a lot of drinks because I was flirting and sitting on their laps. He insisted it wasn&#8217;t appropriate and said he never wanted to see me making physical advances while I&#8217;m on shift again.<br />
I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;ll make it through my next shift without wetting all over. I really need to hang onto this job, but I don&#8217;t think I can hold my pee that long!<br />
