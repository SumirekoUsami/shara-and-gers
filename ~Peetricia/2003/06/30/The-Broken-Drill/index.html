                <p>Last week I had to go to a Handy shop in a big shopping mall. My drill didn&#8217;t work and i had called the shop owner if it is possible to get a new. When I arrived at the shop, it was terribly busy, so I decided to go for a little shopping tour and come back later. It was a very hot day so I went into a cafe and bought an ice cream and a coke and sat out on the balcony. Afterwards, I went into some clothing shops and bought a nice short top. Before I returned to the Handy shop I bought another bottle of coke and then I slowly walked back.<br />
When I entered the shop, only two guys were inside looking at the shop windows. Behind the counter I saw a big very well built guy with dark brown hair and wonderful blue eyes. I think he was from Croatia. &#8220;Hello,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I had called you about four hours ago because my drill doesn&#8217;t work&#8221;.<br />
He smiled at me and took my drill. &#8220;Hmm, what&#8217;s wrong with it?&#8221; he wanted to know.<br />
I explained the problem and noticed that he seemed a little bit nervous. &#8220;I think i have to send it to the factory, I have never heard of one doing that before, I am afraid I wouldn&#8217;t be able to fix that here,&#8221; he said.<br />
&#8220;Damn,&#8221; I said, &#8220;what shall I do without my drill, I use it every day at work?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;I will give you my phone number and I can lend you my old one.&#8221;<br />
I was totally astonished. &#8220;That&#8217;s very nice of you,&#8221; I said, and he wrote his number on my left arm. He was very cute!! We felt in a long conversation and after an hour I realized that I had to go to the toilet. But I was really in no hurry to leave. I also started to realize that the cute guy seemed kind of nervous. I looked at him and asked him if something was wrong. He turned a little bit red and answered that he had pee very badly but the small shop had no toilet. I couldn&#8217;t believe it! &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you close the shop for 5 minutes and go to the toilet at the restaurant?&#8221;<br />
He looked at me with sorrow in his eyes. &#8220;I can&#8217;t, because if I do, and my boss finds out, I will be in big trouble.&#8221; Wow, that&#8217;s pretty tough! He told me that he had been working since 9:30 a.m. and had to stay working till 5:00 p.m. I looked at my watch. It was now 3:00 p.m.<br />
A few customers entered the shop and he had to go back to work. I didn&#8217;t want to go, because it turned me on to watch this strong beautiful guy with desperation in his eyes. I walked up and down in the shop and watched him as he tried to hide his desperation. He was tapping his feet on the ground and couldn&#8217;t stand still. It took a long time till the people left the shop. But when they were outside he held his penis and started to sigh. &#8220;Oh my gosh, I can&#8217;t hold it longer– I will pee my pants if I can&#8217;t get to the loo.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Shall I watch the shop and you go for a short moment?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;No&#8221; he answered. &#8220;My boss will come within the next hour and when he sees that I am not here, I have a huge problem.&#8221;<br />
I laughed, &#8220;On the other hand, you will have another very big problem in a short while, now won&#8217;t you,&#8221; and while I was laughing I noticed my own very full bladder. He smiled a little bit, but I could see that he was concentrating all his attention on not peeing in his pants.<br />
We talked another 30 minutes about a lot of things but it seemed like he didn&#8217;t really listen to a lot of what I said– his attention was elsewhere. Soon, I felt that I had lost a little bit of pee in my pants. I crossed my legs but tried not to show my own desperation. I like the feeling of being desperate.<br />
The guy seemed to panic. He was looking around and walking up and down. &#8220;I can&#8217;t hold it much longer!!! What the hell shall I do?&#8221; He was holding his penis and his stomach and his eyes were full of tears. I could see a wet spot on his light brown trousers. &#8220;OH NO!!!&#8221; he shouted and ran through a small door. I could hear him peeing on the ground. It seemed like hours until he came back. On the front of his trousers i could see a big wet spot.<br />
&#8220;What have you done,&#8221; I asked him. He answered with a calm voice that he had peed in the small storeroom. I smiled at him and then turned around to leave.<br />
It turned me on in a very special way. As I walked to my car, I felt my bladder calling me again. My panties were still a little bit wet and now a bit cold so it was much more difficult to hold in. I would drive quickly home, I thought, and go on the loo there. But it was a big mistake!! At the street there was a big traffic jam. &#8220;Oh my goodness!&#8221; I shouted. I crossed my legs and held my crotch while I tried to think about something beautiful. But it didn&#8217;t work. The huge floods of pee caused an unbearable pressure on my bladder. Another big squirt went into my pants. I knew then that I never would make it home so I tried to think of a solution of my problem. But it was too late. I felt that I couldn&#8217;t hold it any longer. I jumped out of the car and soon my pee was running down my legs. I hid behind the car and let my pee go. It was a very good feeling. Some people watched me peeing through my panties, but i didn&#8217;t care about that. And thank God, I had worn a skirt, and my car didn&#8217;t have to have a soaking.<br />
