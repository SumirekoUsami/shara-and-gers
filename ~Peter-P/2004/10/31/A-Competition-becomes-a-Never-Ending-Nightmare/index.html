                <p>A Competition Becomes a Never Ending Nightmare<br />
If I had superhuman abilities, I would like to get invisible and to have mind–control over strong bladdered women. It should be possible to find them by their thoughts while they are holding it. Afterwards I would read and manipulate their minds while looking inside of them while they are doing their best to hold it.<br />
Then the following situation would be possible. Possibly it could also happen without any manipulation, just because these two women are very ambitious and really tough.<br />
Note from Ger: This story is of course complete fiction. Don&#8217;t even try to hold your pee as long as written below. Not even in a kind of sadistic game. Holding your pee too long – 24 hours for instance – damages your bladder and kidneys in a very bad way. This quickly leads to blood poisoning and you will die. Sooo&#8230; consider this as weird fiction and don&#8217;t try it at home.<br />
***<br />
There are two really sexy ladies in tight mini skirts and high heels that spontaneously start a hold–it competition in a bar:<br />
Beverly has long brown hair playing around her beautiful face. Lucy is a killer–blonde lady. They both are really tough, have strong bladders and an enormous will. They both are dangerously ambitious– neither one is willing to lose so they play until they nearly end up damaging their bladders. When the bar closes, they take all their willpower and strength to walk over to Beverly&#8217;s house to continue their competition.<br />
In the house they try to speed up their painful and desperate competition, which is not a game any more for them. They change from their tight skirts into stretch mini skirts, drink diuretic tea and juice, lie down on the floor, and put their beautiful legs vertical to the wall. By this trick the blood pressure at their kidneys comes up to a higher value and they produce more and more yellow juice against the extreme pressure in their bladders. This slows down when their plane abdomens are totally distended and bulging like big melons. They are in full desperation and really start to panic with the thought that their poor bladders would explode. Neither one of them have had an experience like this before and they wonder if they could get hurt in the next few minutes or if it could even happen in the next few seconds. But both are sick with ambition: It can&#8217;t and won&#8217;t happen– they refuse to stop without winning after hours of all this unbearable pain, desperation, and exhaustion!<br />
Then they decide to make the competition as hard as possible to find an end to the horrible situation. They take strong corsets, pull them as tight as possible, and change their stretch skirts to leather mini skirts with large belts. To round out this outfit they slip onto the most extreme high–heeled shoes they can find that are high but without platforms. Believe it or not, they leave home and take a long walk near the loudly gurgling and murmuring river near the village. They are quite breathless in their much too tight clothing and rock hard bladders. It is like a nightmare but they must endure it – this must be the reward from all of the years they did not use the toilet, even when it led to extreme pain and desperation. Both try to look as though they have no problems – to discourage their competitor.<br />
They start to talk about their experiences with full and overfilled bladders for long periods of time. They find out that both of them just use the toilet once a day to be able to sleep at night. On their weekends they clean their kidneys to prevent stones and other bladder disease. Both had been proudly able to hold out for 3 days during wedding parties on several occasions, with many drinks but without having to pee. Both only use their own toilets and refuse to use any others since their childhood. Neither is willing to change this long tradition. What a horrible situation – a never–ending nightmare of total desperation, unbearable pain, and urgency, with bladders that normally would have exploded long before. But instead of this now are bonded in sexy clothes.<br />
Every movement increases the pain, every spoken word is like a hit on their bursting stomach. Every muscle of their beautiful bodies is tensed to its breaking point. Sweat is between their legs, on their cheeks, all over their slim and beautiful, but now muscular and hard bodies. Their calves and legs are cramped after the now three hours walk on the so much too high heels. Standing on 7 inch high heels (18 cm) is rarely possible, but a few beautiful women really can walk on these shoes. After much training it looks very sexy, when they not just solve to wear it, but really have learned to move on them with grace like a ballet dancer. But after a while their toes, balls and complete feet get really painful. Their calves and legs get harder and harder and it needs very much self–control not to stagger around – but still to walk just like on clouds. But Beverly and Lucy have a much harder problem: Their bladders cramp in short periods like some minutes before a confinement – but they get no babies, their poor and totally exhausted bodies try to push out the now dangerous mass of liquid, which nearly blows up these sexy babes just like totally overfilled balloons in the sun. But these completely stupid females are too strong and much too ambitious to give up and let it go – to relieve themselves now nearly 18 hours after they started a simple game. Normally a bladder would never have resisted such a pressure, but they exaggerated it totally. They both had blown up their bodies to the absolute maximum, than pressed it into very slim and extremely tight clothes – and to give their bladders no chance, tied their corsets to a really wasp–waist, nobody knows how they did it, but now they cannot escape without giving in and pee outside their own toilet the first time in their lifes – and they both were extremely proud of their absolutely non beatable bladders.<br />
Our sexy ladies are not able anymore to walk more then three steps without a stop to bend over and nearly get a blacked out by the unimaginable pain and exhaustion. They cannot think clearly anymore – but they don&#8217;t give in&#8230;<br />
If you think this would be the most extreme horror situation our two tough beauties have to solve, you are wrong:<br />
They both stand the situation second for second, minute for minute, hour for hour. And suddenly they get aware, that they have an important fitness competition in the near city in just two hours. They are the favorites of their club and have to win the cup. What to do?<br />
They stagger home with their now weak legs in their much much too high heeled sexy shoes. On the so stony walk beside the river it is impossible to run. And it is impossible to survive without shoes. They have to run or to walk very very quickly in their tight skirts and corsets. The river is still making just that noises they cannot do theirselfs all the time. Their legs cramp more and more, get weaker and weaker. The tight skirts cut deep into their skin and press their bladders again and again an again. Their breath is flat because the whole inner body is filled with their heavy and rockhard bladders, which now swings and rocks up and down with all might. How heavy can these gallons of water be&#8230;<br />
After a not ending powerful walk and run they reach the house – they don&#8217;t know how, but they did it. The time is rare and they have to piss a quarter of an hour and again and again. So they decide not to pee, but to hold it until they are ready to start. They have a shower to wash away all the sweat. Water is gurgling and hissing, but they have to stand it – after all the time&#8230; They style their hair and do their make up – still hoppling and fidgeting all the time. At the end they have not a second for the loo and hurry up to the car – on their super high heels, they forgot to change shoes.<br />
It is impossible to concentrate in this state of maximum pain and cramps and exhaustion. They have to stop their car very abruptly more then once to prevent a car accident – and their bladders nearly come out of their bodies, heavy as they are. It seems so unreal and absolute impossible to them, but it happens. Why is a body with an overtrained bladder able to contain and hold such a harmful mass of water for hours and hours? Why does it not explode to stop this nightmare, they wonder&#8230;<br />
At the hall, where the fitness contest happens, many friends and neighbors wait for the two sexy favorites. They want to cry, just to piss, to let out the source of all the torture, to stop their supernatural and superhuman effort to hold many liters of water in a tight body. But they don&#8217;t let it go – they still hold it and reinforce the disastrous situation from minute to minute. Even they think it is impossible to get it worse, but it gets more and more. It is impossible not to fidget with such an oversized but brutal compressed bladder, but they have to, in this cruel torture trap.<br />
At the warm up, they get additional unbelievable attacks of pain and all their strength seems to help their bladders to push out the incredible masses of water. But they have to stand it and they do anyhow. It is not understandable to us, but they hold their extremely bulging bladders pulled in, just with their strong abs muscles. Do it not just for a minute, but on and on and on.<br />
Then the long time of waiting is too much for them. They sit down in an empty corner behind a wardrobe and soundless cry – but it does not help but just contracts the stomach and compresses the bladder like everything in the moment – just stronger, much stronger than they can stand. They clean up their makeup and sit on a bench totally apathetic for half an hour. Then the first of them, Beverly, has to show her beautiful and fit body. The other one, Lucy is just on her own.<br />
On stage our sexbomb has to show the different muscles. Has to strain the muscles and contract them to the absolute maximum. Every movement, every straining presses her bladder more and more and it is getting out of control. But she has to strengthen it again and again, to hold it a never ending time. Nobody knows about her torture and she has to smile while she is dying thousands of deads in the spot light. Then it is over and she has to leave the stage for a new and endless wait.<br />
Her friend had Lucy given up and used a toilet behind stage. Now Beverly has to suffer on her own as never a human being or another creature on earth before. The demoralization is really hard for her and her friend Lucy tries to make her also give up soon. She is in rage because she lost the first hold–it competition in her life. She is angry, that she used a public loo. Before she ever had laughed about weak people using a stinky toilet instead of going home like her&#8230;<br />
Lucy now talked about the fine feeling of an emptied bladder. Her own bladder was still a painful and cramped lump, but that was her secret. She had to piss again and again and the toilet sounds could be heard in the room where the resisting poor sexy – our Beverly – sat. Every hissing was like a shot in her body. Her bladder then contracted as much as it could. It was not changing the size, but worked directly against the cramped, weak sphincter and it felt like an open wound where somebody puts a hot coal into. She was as desperate as it is possible to be desperate, thought about dying quick, but did not give in, did not let the masses of her urine go.<br />
Then Beverly was alone, while her cruel friend Lucy showed her sexy body to the audience. It was not better without Lucie&#8217;s nerving horrible tries to get her weak, because her body now spoke to her in the most extreme and impressible language it could – if you don&#8217;t feel it, you cannot imagine what this poor sexy lady had to go through in this not ending time.<br />
Later on Lucy tried again to hinder her to hold it much longer then her with all might. But Beverly, our tough hold–it winner in her anger decided not to show her pain and not to fidget, not to press her legs together anymore and pull in her stomach as much as she could (or not could) . It got worse and worser, became as bad as it could be and much more, but she anyhow was too strong to leave control – unfortunately for her, really fascinating for us&#8230;!!!<br />
Beverly&#8217;s second show on stage was an unimaginable horror, because she had to do exercises, which maximized the pressure on her bladder, many times. Then she had to wait again for ages with Lucy, the cruel looser, who surprisingly took her from behind and pressed her bladder with all her strength and might. And Lucy was a good trained fitness model&#8230; While this the water was still running in the bathroom. Lucy tried it again and again and strong sexy Beverly had to fight against her inner. She was unable to do anything to get free, out of Lucy&#8217;s clinch, because the pain totally paralyzed her.<br />
When Beverly was alone later on, she wanted just to give up, but she could not, because the toilet door was blocked – water still running and hissing. She stood at the door and had one cramp after the other until Lucy came back from stage. How can a body stand that, why is it fixed to hold it on and on, just because the will has ordered to wait till the home–toilet is right there?<br />
The last show–part was the hardest. Beverly, our furiously fighting babe had choreographed a free show part with many leg–ups to her nose, some slow and with power and some quick hitting her lower body and her bladder hardly. By this she had to show all her muscles on her sporty and slim body. She was not too muscular but now with all the holding, her muscles contracted or sometimes cramped. It was fascinating, what power and strength she showed – and still looked very female an extremely sexy. Just her eyes showed the extreme and never ending pain she had to stand for now more than 27 hours.<br />
Beverly won the golden cup, had to give another show – the winner&#8217;s show. And after a long long time she finished. But now she had to go to the housebar with all her friends. And they drank all the night. Her bladder was completely full and did not fill further, but just the thought of getting more and more filled was too much for her. But she was too shy and proud to stand up and go home – so she stayed and stood the endless horror longer and longer in total desperation – but without any sign of fidgeting or showing the cramps which drove through her body and bladder.<br />
Now she knew, she would stand it as long as she wanted or longer. Her body was too strong to give her pain und suffer an end. She could hold it, but could not stand the pain, the exhausting effort to stand it and the cramps all the time. It was the hell – the real and incredible cruel hellfire in her. In the next afternoon the party was over, she hold it now for more than 45 hours.<br />
Everybody took a taxi (cab) home and she did not trust to do so also. So she walked home on her 7&#8221; high heels – just bought for a joke and now worn for more than a day because of the silly and goddammned hold–it competition. By car it was about an hour and by food on these neckbreaking high heeled torture instruments she needed about one and a half day. Every step on her cramped feet with the cramped calves, legs, ass and back was a hellfire for her now absolutely revolting bladder. She did not know, how her body took all the power still to knead on this rock hard organ. She also did not understand how she could clamp her sphincter under this conditions till now, but unfortunately it worked anyhow. The way was bad, the stones too sharp to put off the shoes and too rough to walk on these artistic tools. But she walked on, suffering and too tired to cry. Her tight mini skirt and the fucking corset made her worst, but she walked on and on and on. She could feel her heartbeat hammering on her bladder, which was totally compressed and pushed up in her body. The grumbling of her now hungry stomach hit on the bursting balloon, her breath was like a big steam hammer on her exploding bladder and her tortured, hot and wound sphincter. Her peehole was totally cramped, weak und needless, but it still worked under her effort to hold it – just till her home and own toilet.<br />
Then Beverly really reached her home, suddenly it was in front of her. She thought about the biggest and longest piss she ever had. With her last power she staggered up the front steps. Panic overcame her – she was so near to her toilet and now thought, no knew, but just thought, she would not solve the last few meters.<br />
Were was her key? She could not find it! – It was not in her bag!<br />
Lucy, her ex–friend and competitor in the hold–it &#8220;game&#8221; had been at the bag at the bar, she remembered&#8230;<br />
With her last power she walked to the village and to the phone cell – it was broken.<br />
She had to cross the whole village, which she did within an hour. Her need was so strong and urgent now, that she speeded up on her high heels as it were running shoes. She ignored the pain and tried not to show it to her neighbors. It was incredible – it worked but was very bad to her condition und her super extreme desperation.<br />
She called her competitor, but this cruel witch just told her to take the key from her home – she was not willing to go out of her house. The way to the neighbor village was about 4 hours by food with normal low and comfortable shoes. Our poor sexy got it in a 5 hours march violating her weak body, her cramped legs and feet and gave a maximum of pain to her exploding but bounded bladder.<br />
At her goal she decided to give up now and piss into Lucy&#8217;s toilet – it just was too much to her now. The first dribbling was near the floodgates, but she anyhow hold it back – just a second longer and another second&#8230;<br />
Now the pain grew again to a maximum above the absolute maximum. The way became longer and longer. After half of the way normally it goes quicker, but here it took longer and longer. It was an endless, an more than endless torture. 86 hours&#8230; Incredible! Incredible as the absolute overfilling, the compression, the will battle, the show with all the harming movements, the sadistic efforts of her ex friend and the long, long party. Incredible also the long march on these devil built torturing shoes. She could not believe, that she still hold these extreme masses of water inside her, by sexy clothes more than clenched, body. Normally it would have flown out by her pulling in her stomach or at least at the river walk. Her body worked so strong to push out the dangerous and harming fluid bulging out her bladder like at a high pregnant woman. Why the hell she was so strong and so mad to hold it back for nearly 90 hours now. Supergirl would not have done it, why was her body stronger than itself, just to extend a situation, which was completely impossible? Why the hell did she all her trainings to her bladder instead of emptying it when it got full. She had been so stupid to be proud of agonizing her bladder to an ironhard and unbeatable muscle. And now three, nearly four days ago she forced it too much. Her bladder was exploding in slow motion – a never ending burst and she had to stand it. Also these goddamned high heels pressing her tortured feet to a position, which was not to solve. And she wore it not just for fun at home, but now for days on the road, in the forest and had to wear them on her way home also&#8230;<br />
At Lucy&#8217;s house she had to ring and wait in total panic – so near to the relieve. But the door did not open. &#8220;Piss on the street, that everybody can see how much you overrate your bladder&#8221;, she heard from inside. But that was too much for her. She stood there on her heels, holding her strong but now more than weak thighs together without twisting them or making a helpful knot into her beautiful legs. Regardless of her totally exhausted and tired face she looked more beautiful than before by her superhuman strength and inner power.<br />
How long would Lucy tease her? For minutes, for hours or for days? She was so desperate as never before and not willing to show it – not here! It was really not possible, but her long time desperation was increased once more. But she did not give in. She knew, she now had to walk home after the waiting time, but she would solve it also – unfortunately she was too strong for a so helpful breakdown&#8230;<br />
After hours of waiting and sound attacks from flushing toilets and running water, the key did not appear. It was a cold and damp morning and partly it rained with the cruel sound of hissing pee. She felt cold, very cold, but did not allow herself to fidget, not to twist her legs or to bend over. Her pee stood just millimeters behind her floodgates and they became weak and weaker from second to second, but she got no release. It was so hard, so injuring her, she felt her bladder damaging, but could not do anything but waiting. Waiting to the dangerous and harming event, because a relieve was not allowed to her unfortunately too good trained pity bladder. To give in was impossible to her, not after all that fighting, not in front of the neighbors and at least not for the fun of that witch, Lucy. Before this she preferred to die the most atrocious and hideous death on earth !<br />
In the rainy afternoon Lucy gave up her dirty game. It was too much to her to see how the winner of the hold–it competition stood there in front of her house, her legs – just for provocation – put a little apart and without any sign of a problem. She didn&#8217;t know how near the breakdown was and how her new enemy had to suffer, because her bladder did not become weak enough to let it go involuntarily.<br />
The key flew out of the window into a small frog pool in the garden. It was impossible to see the ground under a thick layer of seaweed. Our lovely fighter pulled off her aching shoes and went into the cold and green water. The cold water hit her like a footstep onto her critically filled bladder, which seemed to fill again more and more. It could not be, but it felt like. And her desperation and panic grew more and more. This &#8220;hit&#8221; by the cold water made her a belly–ache like a big caliber shot. But she knew, she had not much time anymore. So she went into the pool, deeper and deeper until her beautiful legs were in the much too cold water up to her short mini skirts seam. Her feed lost the feeling in the ice–cold water but her bladder gave her more and more feeling of the most horrible kind. She knew, it was not allowed to her to give up outside her home. Not now and not here!<br />
After 20 minutes she found the key, put it out with her food and felt a new horrible painful expression of her body. She had lifted her leg over the water. It looked like a ballet exercise. Her thigh pressed hardly on her abdomen and her over–sensitive bladder, which was at its end of strength now. She quickly bend her knee and took her shank down to take the key with her hand. Her body was so paralyzed by the pain, that it used all her concentration to put her beautiful, still lifted leg back, down into the cold water. A new shock hit her und squeezed her poor and overstrained bladder again. Then she tried to come out of the cold water, but there were some deeper holes under the dirty water and she needed about half an hour to find a dry way out.<br />
Completely frozen she cleaned her legs from the seaweed. For this she had to bend over deeply. This made her more and more pain und nearly drove her crazy by agony. But she knew, that Lucy the witch was behind her window and so she did many unnecessary and very painful movements just to show, that she was incredible strong and had no real pain, as hard and overfilled as her bladder was. In her inner, it was like seeing a dark and thousands red and white stars behind her eyes. Now she knew, she would not reach home by time, because her bladder became really weak. It was too much to her now. But she wanted to be out of sight or better out of the village, when it would come over her! Her feeling was like it just started to stream out of her horizontally, but it was still at the last millimeter inside her.<br />
She put on her high heels and wondered, that she had walked quick and also run on it. They were so much too high and she had to take all her will not to fall out of them. Her feed were extremely bended, her heel was in the same direction as her leg, her sole and toes were bent in an angle of 90 degree or more, her feed balls were presses on the ground with all her weight on just a very few square–inches and her tip toes were squeezed to a point. It needs much power to balance on these shaky pencil thin but 7&#8221; high heels. Her beautiful calves showed just a shadow of the hard fight to hold her heels as high as they were – for ages. She wondered that her feed did not slip down in these pumps and build an arc just to the half of the height. Just standing was an acrobatic act. Walking on it was quite impossible, but she just did it and she did it with grace, slow as quick, it was wonderful to see her walking in these sky high heeled buildings of an evil, who wanted to see beautiful women give in or stagger some steps in total pain and with quickly beginning calve cramps and give in then. She was much too beautiful to exist. Her sporty and muscular but slender and really female legs, her bulging ass, the obligatory super mini skirt, her tight waist and good trained upper body with a wonderful bosom, lovely big but hard breasts, standing itself without any bra. Normally she had a lovely face, but now it looked exhausted, tired and hard by standing the endless and incredible pain, which steady increased, although it still was at the absolute maximum. And she looked strength by her never ending fight against a break of the dam, against all reason and better knowledge. Her long and beautiful hair was just a little naturally curled and after all the sweatdriving powerplay, not pasted or fatty. She had strong muscles, but she did not show them. In her fitness training it was a big surprise, when she contracted her hard muscles and e.g. her biceps appeared like sharp drawn ball and afterwards was gone in seconds. So she always looked sporty and extremely beautiful, feminine and so sexy, that you would never forget her after getting just a short glimpse of her.<br />
This sexy supergirl now stood all the pain and unbearable pressure for more than 90 hours. Nobody would think something like this, as relaxed as she looked in the moment. But we know, that in her poor body the biggest catastrophe built up from second to second. Something, which was a disaster as ghostly and monsterly harmful as all her strength and will power which she needed to come to this normally completely impossible state.<br />
Now Beverly had to come out of the village, but her bladder was too weak for that walk. As she was out of sight from the house of cruel Lucy she stood still, twisted her legs, tried to open her belt und jumped up and down in full and totally overwhelming desperation – all on the same time. But her bladder was too overfilled, too strained, too heavy by the enormous capacity of now about three or more liters of water, much too much – and long clenched into her slim body and her sphincter too weak.<br />
Normally at a capacity of about 1,5 liters, she started to pull in her belly–muscles, to give her bladder not too much volume to fill more. She had hold this many times for a weekend or the mentioned wedding parties. When she did not manipulate with her abdominal muscles, her bladder could hold up to two liters or on some days a little more.<br />
Once she had slept too long after a long night in a nightbar and had her bladder completely overfilled and bulging out. It hurt really bad, but it was too late to pee and come to the office by time. So she grit her teeth and hold it the whole Thursday long. After work she drove to one of the countryside wedding parties with all her pee in, and damned the last night. She could not sleep the night with her now crampy belly–ache but in the morning she smiled, made some jokes and helped building up all the tables and benches. She was frustrated, but it was her own fault and she didn&#8217;t want to disturb the happiness of the party by her more and more growing problem. It was very hard to her to pull in her stomach against the extreme pressure and pain, but she did it. After 3 days of party and gallons of beer, whine and other drinks, she was invited to stay over night and drive to the office directly in the morning. She was too proud and shy to talk about her more than forced urge and more than unbearable pain. So she stayed over night with tears in her eyes and came to her office with her bladder overfilled to the absolute maximum she ever had. She solved the day, did some very urgent extra work until the late night and came home at about midnight. She ran to her loo sat down – and stood up again to get a bucket. She needed all her willpower to do that, but she was pride to measure 2,3 liters after 5 days and 4 nights. That was her personal record ––– till now&#8230;<br />
So now in the present, she was in the wrong village frozen to ice with a super short mini skirt and high heels which did not allow to walk on them. Her bladder was giving up the first time in her life and she was 4 hours from home&#8230;<br />
She suddenly became very angry on her ex–friend to end her lifelong phase of having a strong bladder und just going to her own toilet as hard as it was sometimes. She started to walk faster und faster, her ice–cold legs got harder and harder and started to cramp again, but she still speeded up as much as she could without falling over her own feet. She clickered over the pavement of the road, now nearly running, but running was not possible with these cramped legs on her high high heels. The cramps got worse, but she held her speed with all power of her will now. Every step undeadenly hit on her bladder. Her pain increased again to its absolute maximum she had these days and ever in her life. When she came to the forest, she decided to try to reach home. It was quite impossible, but she wanted to try to hold her bladder as the non beatable – she could not give up, not because of the unfair game of this witch. Beverly nearly run over the rough and partly too weak ground, stumbled – but did not slow down. Her legs and feet were just one big source of cramp and worst pain. Her bladder had no hard hits on the forest ground, but her partly really staggering walk made her fight with all muscles to stay upright instead of falling down with probably hard inner hurts and unrepairable damages on her bladder. She was surprised what incredible extreme pain she had to suffer – and that she still was dry&#8230;<br />
After 3 hours (!) she came home and the key was right. She opened the door and speeded up with her last power to reach her toilet after now 95 hours. She tried to open her belt, but her bladder pressed in such a hard way, that she was not able to open it. All her fight and effort for nothing? No, please not this to me&#8230;!!!<br />
She tried to lift her extremely tight skirt and wanted to pull down her pants in now more than extreme panic. It did not work, because her pants were fixed between her skin and her skirts waist–band. Now again she was not willing to give in – not damage her clothes, but pee as a hero on her own toilet.<br />
She pulled in her stomach again and again. She felt her sphincter getting weaker and weaker, but did it on and on. After half an hour – a never ending time in this state and so near beside her toilet, Beverly got it off and sat down. She started peeing –– but in the last second, the first drop out, but still not fallen down, she stopped herself: She would never have such a full bladder again – it would be a sin not to measure the fluid, the pissing time and her extremely bulging abdomen!<br />
With all the little rest of her will, she staggered down to the cellar and wondered, why she did not step out of these shoes. She came down the steep and tiny steps with it and looked for a big bucket. She got real panic again, as she did not find one quickly. After a while she got it and hasted upstairs.<br />
To find out how much her abdomen was bulging she had to put off the refractory belt and her much to tight leather skirt&#8230; She tried it and tried and the valuable time flew away. Her work got harder and harder – she had tears of pain in her eyes and was like drunken by the extreme pain. She was in danger to damage her bladder, but did not stop her doing. Again and again she pulled at her belt with all her force – and she was really strong as we know. It did not help and she did not want to give in. She tortured herself in rage and fury until she got the belt off. 2 hours she fought against her bladder without loosing a single drop of pee. Now she hold it for 97 hours !!!!<br />
She started to measure her bladder bulging out to the maximum, then she got an idea: She would hold it now deliberately until 100 hours were over – or better 123 hours. She had to pull in her bladder again as deep as ever possible without any technical devices and hold it for further 26 hours. The short time without the extreme pressure of her skirt, belt and corset made her wanton – and we know, she will do what she decides once. Good luck for the hardest 26 hours anybody ever survived&#8230;!<br />
At the first try to pull in her belly, she found out her completely madden and really dangerous mistake, but now it was too late for her – she could not give in&#8230;<br />
At these hours she had new maxim of pain, of exhaustion and the seconds passed very slowly on her clock. She was fully desperate und afraid to die with an big and loud bang, but she pulled in her bladder with all her might and strength and her will battle was absolutely endless. Now she had time to think about what she did, but she was too tired and too exhausted for a clear thought. She just felt unbearable fear and panic coming up in her, covering her and pulling her down. She worked with all her strength against this fear und pulled her bulging abdomen in, deeper and deeper. It hurt her more and more and she – typical for her – reacted with more and more force against her bladder&#8230;<br />
At the 100th hour she started to lift up her legs up to her nose. She did it alternating, 100 time the right one and 100 times the other one. And then started again and again. She forced her desperation in this much too dangerous and unbearable game – probably to loose her willbattle a.s.a.p. She hit her bladder harder and harder and repeated her powerplay for 23 hours. But her poor bladder was too strong and she drove crazy while doing this. Nobody would do this exercise as long – even not with an empty bladder.<br />
It is too horrible to describe it. Nobody can figure or imagine this fight, this fear and panic and the absolute maximum of pain for a never ending time.<br />
But at the end, our sexy fighter reached her target 123 hours. That is 5 days and 3 hours at the absolute border of everything she could stand.<br />
Her piss was a little more than 4.5 liters in just 2 minutes. A stream with a power, which would have damaged her pants and probably the her sexy mini skirt if this would have happened outside, with her clothes on.<br />
You will not believe it, but Beverly had her torturing high heels on the whole time and after pissing she had a shower and went to a bar – with her still unbearably and incredibly hurting bladder. After opening her floodgates once, her bladder was in such a weak state, that she had to press her legs together as strong as she could and twisted it twice. She was fidgeting the whole night, but always still standing on these 7 inch high heels.<br />
From this day on, she wears her torturing sky high heels every day at home, in the office and on the street. The colleagues call her Beverly Heels now. More and more often she has her heels some millimeters above the ground. That needs really much power – but is the sign, that she has her bladder absolutely overfilled again and by this she involuntarily contracts her leg muscles more than normally.<br />
Before the contest, Beverly just went to the bathroom once a day to let out all her pressing and hurting hot piss. Now she overfills her bladder regularly with her trick to lay her legs up and relax her belly. And she holds it 2 days now and then has a relaxing day to clean her kidneys to prevent damages. On these days she holds it without her overloading trick and drinks and pisses after 8 pm. as often as it is necessary.<br />
If you see a beautiful sexy on tower high heels and with a super short tight mini skirt, then look, if she probably has her bladder so much overfilled, that it makes her crazy. But probably you will not see her pain, because she is able to hide the most extreme pain for days, if she just is willing. And that is more and more often. But her personal record will be really unbeatable forever. Or however, will she beat it sometimes for you?<br />
