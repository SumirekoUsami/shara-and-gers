                <p>Part 1 Something very strange happened to me a couple of months back that I&#8217;m still trying to make sense of. It&#8217;s said that sexual response changes as we age so maybe that&#8217;s it &#8216; all I know is that I&#8217;m still trying to work it out. Here&#8217;s what happened. I had met up with an old friend for a Friday evening drink after work &#8216; well she was drinking wine, I was driving so was on fizzy water but still had several glasses. Despite the water I didn&#8217;t feel any need to pee before we left and nor did Jane so neither of us visited the ladies. The drive to Jane&#8217;s house and then home normally takes about half an hour so I had no real concerns about being caught short. As she was getting into the car Jane muttered that she ought to have used the loo before we left but would hang on as it was only ten minutes to wait. However, on arrival we sat outside her house talking and giggling for some time until she suddenly told me not to make her laugh again or she&#8217;d wet her pants and that she had better go in quickly. I realised then that I too needed the loo quite badly – the feeling had sort of crept up on me. I thought of popping into Jane&#8217;s to use her toilet but I really wanted to get home so said my goodbyes and drove off. Of course, every traffic light was against me and the constant gear changes and braking became agony as I was really quite desperate now. The drive seemed to take forever and as I stopped the car in the drive I realised that not only was I now absolutely bursting but that my knickers actually felt quite damp. I do tend to leak a bit when full though usually only if I laugh too much or cough so the dampness caught me off guard, to the extent that I put my hand under my skirt and felt my gusset! I was wearing my usual soft satin knickers, tights and a pair of cotton Sloggi control briefs on top to keep the tights up and was certainly damp, in fact quite wet, having leaked through both pairs of pants. I reddened as I realised that I&#8217;d actually wet myself quite a bit without really realising it. Then something unexpected happened. As I pressed on my damp crotch I felt not only incredibly aroused but close to an orgasm – and even closer to wetting myself totally while sat in the car if I didn&#8217;t get into the house quickly! That was easier said than done. I almost lost it getting out of the car and as I unlocked the door felt a warming in my crotch and a trickle down my thigh. Thank goodness I had a downstairs toilet off the hallway, not that it made much difference to the outcome for as I slammed the front door and started to lift my skirt my bladder gave up. I felt a hot flood fill my knickers and run down my legs but had the presence of mind to at least sit down on the loo. I looked down in horror and wonder at the flood pouring through my pants and tights – for goodness sake I was 47 and I here I was wetting myself in my own toilet! But something strange was happening. The hot flow filling my pants felt incredibly erotic, almost orgasmic. I couldn&#8217;t stop myself. I put my hand between my legs and squeezed myself through my soaking knickers. The resulting orgasm was incredible &#8216; I&#8217;d experienced nothing like it before. In fact I think I came three times altogether– each one making me pee again. Afterwards I just sat there shaking and exhausted, trying to work out what had just happened. I know my bladder control&#8217;s not perfect – after all I have had two children, but compared to some friends my pelvic floor is pretty good. There have been times on a girl&#8217;s night out when I&#8217;ve come home with a wet gusset but I&#8217;ve never before actually lost control and totally wet myself. So not making it too the loo in time was itself a shock but the way it made me feel was even more so – I&#8217;d wet myself and it had made me come. Why? I suspect sexual frustration may have had something to do with it. Since I divorced almost two years ago I haven&#8217;t had a sexual partner and don&#8217;t even masturbate very often. Maybe my body just had to come and the full bladder, my movements while driving and then the loss of control as I wet my pants just triggered something. I gradually came back to a rather soggy reality and feeling exhausted went straight up to my bedroom. I ought to have showered but instead just peeled down my wet knickers and tights and simply left them on the bathroom floor, dried myself off and went to bed. I slept better than I had for a very long time, waking much later than usual and only then from the pain of a bursting bladder. Without thinking and still half asleep I put my hand between my legs but touching myself almost caused me to lose control and wet my bed. Dashing into the bathroom I sat on the loo just I time, suddenly remembering what had happened the previous evening and noticing the damp and stained evidence lying by the wash bin and the faint but distinct aroma of unwashed wet knickers in the air. I spent the day at home relaxing, feeling strangely randy and thinking about how and why I had had such a wonderful orgasm &#8216; and wanting another one. On reflection three things were interconnected &#8216; the full bladder, touching myself and wetting my knickers. That was the theory so the only thing to do was find out more. Part 2 The more I thought about my accident and the result the more I needed to know. Had anything similar happened to other women perhaps? It didn&#8217;t take long online to discover that for some of us a full bladder can be a real turn on, arousing and giving explosive if perhaps rather wet orgasms. I also found forum posts from women who admitted that if their partner touched them down there when they were full they would lose control and wet themselves. Things were beginning to make sense. What I had experienced for the first time yesterday was similar to the experiences of many of the forum posters so I wasn&#8217;t alone – in fact I was now quite intrigued. Feeling very naughty I realised that I had to see if it would happen again. Preparations were in order! To replicate Friday night I dressed in similar underwear and drank more water and tea than usual, knowing that tea especially always has me running to the loo. I remade the bed as well, putting a thick towel over the protective waterproof mattress cover that I use to prevent mattress stains from my often heavy and irregular periods. If I experimented while in bed then I&#8217;d just create some extra washing, not that I actually intended to! Another pot of tea and I sat down to watch TV, shivering slightly with anticipation. The tea has its usual effect and within an hour I needed to pee quite badly. When I reached the point of crossing my legs and squeezing my thighs together I almost chickened out. All my instincts were to get to the loo before I had an accident and I had to force myself to ignore the feelings and continue to hold on. The anticipation increased and I felt the same arousal as I had before, especially when I lost control slightly and felt my knickers dampen. Now I had to do something or I&#8217;d wet my sofa. I hobbled to the bathroom, amazingly without wetting my pants even more, sat on the loo and rubbed myself between my legs. The result was electric. I immediately lost control and absolutely soaked my knickers again, coming twice as the flow died away. Again I felt exhausted and just sat there in my wet things for a good 20 minutes, occasionally rubbing myself gently through my wet pants. The warmth turned to a cold clamminess and I suddenly felt ashamed of myself. What was I doing? There I was, a mature woman who had just deliberately peed herself and enjoyed it. Then I thought back to the Internet posts and how others had found the same thing arousing. What the hell, it was my secret and the resulting orgasms certainly made me feel better. After I&#8217;d showered, changed and put my wet things in the washing machine I went about my day much more relaxed than I had been for some time and, for now, using the loo like a good girl should. A couple of glasses of wine in the evening and I went to bed early, ignoring my usual frumpy cotton nightdress and instead putting on a pair of satin knickers and a slinky satin nightie. I was beginning to feel like a sexual being again, something I&#8217;d lost for some years. Again I slept soundly waking up around 8 o&#8217; clock desperate for a wee (and dry!). The bed was warm and I was relaxed so instead of getting up immediately I continued to lay there on my back, putting off the inevitable for a little longer. I was squeezing my thighs together to help me hold on till without really thinking I held myself as my bladder began to spasm slightly. Before I realised my mistake a hot wet flood was pouring into my knickers, over my hand and spreading under my bum. I came immediately, boy did I come &#8216; it was even better than previously. I completely wet the bed &#8216; my knickers were soaking, my nightie was soaking and the sheet and towel beneath me were soaking but I didn&#8217;t care. If you&#8217;ve never wet the bed like this you have to try it &#8216; it really felt wonderful – the release, the enveloping warmth and wetness and an incredible feeling of naughtiness. I felt no shame this time, it just felt too good and lay there dozing in the wetness for another hour. When I finally got up my nightdress and knickers were clinging to me and despite the towel the wet patch on my bed was a good metre across. Catching sight of myself and the bed in the full length mirror I felt really wicked. I hadn&#8217;t wet the bed since I was a child and yet I&#8217;d just done it almost deliberately, and it felt superb. I&#8217;d broken another social taboo just as I had when I peed myself yesterday and the freedom was quite liberating in addition to the orgasmic benefits. To hell with it &#8216; my knickers, my bed my pleasure. Part 3 Now that I had discovered myself again I wanted more but realised that I&#8217;d have to be a little bit careful. For a start, I didn&#8217;t want to strain my bladder through frequent holding or give myself an infection. Neither was holding on at work or in public a good idea, since I really didn&#8217;t want to embarrass myself by having an accident that others would see. For these reasons I decided to keep my pleasure largely for the weekend when I would have time to myself and could deal with the extra washing more easily. At least that was my intention, though it didn&#8217;t always work out like that. Those first accidents were six months ago now and there have been many more since , perhaps more than I intended but then a girl can&#8217;t have too much of a good thing &#8216; the orgasms are just too wonderful. Since my discovery I&#8217;m almost ashamed to admit that I&#8217;ve wet my pants several times a week and not only at weekends. The weekends are the best though because I have the time to really enjoy holding a bursting bladder with the growing excitement and turn–on of knowing that at some point I&#8217;m going to deliberately wet my knickers or bed. Now I don&#8217;t just wait and then dash to the loo at the last minute as in those first experiments, unless I want to avoid too much mess of course. As long as I know that I&#8217;m not going to be disturbed I put myself in situations where I have an &#8220;accident&#8221; while watching TV, washing up or even in the garden. The kitchen is easy as it has a tiled floor and I just make sure there are a couple of old towels there for mopping up. Then I wait till I&#8217;m bursting and only then start the washing up, enjoying the massive desperation as I put my hands into the warm water. I often leak into my pants immediately, which usually sends me over the top and within seconds I&#8217;m coming and at the same time flooding my knickers, legs and the floor. Wetting myself standing I love &#8216; deliberate as it is it somehow feels more like a genuine accident. I&#8217;ve also tried it in the garden, though only at night when I can&#8217;t be seen. For wetting while watching TV I bought a cheap plastic mattress cover which goes over the sofa and covers part of the floor. A couple of towels on top and one on the floor complete the preparations. I am then able to sit or lie there drinking wine or more often cider, which really makes me wee, feeling the growing pressure in my bladder, occasionally rubbing myself gently (at least until I&#8217;m getting desperate) savouring the increasing dampness in my pants as I both get turned on and leak wee. As I reach bursting point I squeeze myself through my wet knickers and come immediately as my bladder bursts and I soak my pants, tights and the towels beneath me. I&#8217;ll often lay there for ages, savouring my wetness and rubbing myself to more orgasms as I do so and on several occasions I&#8217;ve not bothered to move or change for two or three hours often wetting myself (and coming) a couple more times during the evening. I don&#8217;t do this often though as it feels rather too premeditated and I have to be absolutely sure I won&#8217;t be disturbed. Obviously on weekdays my activities would not only create extra washing but I&#8217;d probably be too exhausted to work anyway! However, although I&#8217;d promised myself I&#8217;d stay dry during the week there have been rather too many occasions when I&#8217;ve given in to the urge. Typically I&#8217;ll have left work in a hurry and forgotten to use the loo before leaving; add in the usual traffic and I have arrived home needing the loo badly, much as I did on that first evening. I give myself a treat on these occasions and will either wet myself sitting on the loo or, if I&#8217;m wearing a washable skirt I&#8217;ll stand in the shower and do it. The orgasms are almost as good and I sometimes just throw my wet clothes in the wash basket to deal with later. For a real treat I wet my bed. This now has a new hospital grade mattress cover and always has a good thick towel under the sheet so that it&#8217;s fully protected at all times, something that&#8217;s quite important, as on three occasions so far I&#8217;ve actually wet in my sleep. The first time it happened I was having a sexy dream that involved me wetting my pants as I came and as I wet myself in my dream I wet the bed in reality. Strangely I didn&#8217;t wake up and it was only as I came round and needing to pee again in the morning that I realised that I was wet. I almost panicked till I remembered the dream and put two and two together. A disconcerting experience though as what if it happened when I was away somewhere. The other couple of times that it&#8217;s happened I was dreaming about wetting the bed and actually did so in my sleep. Unfortunately all three incidents occurred on working days so rather than enjoying them further I had to get up, shower and go to work! As I am always in a rush in the mornings I left the bed with the duvet pulled back till I got home. I have to admit that it did give me a strange thrill to walk into my bedroom in the evening to see and smell the large, often still damp stain on my sheet. The last time it happened I was almost caught out by a friend who turned up earlier than expected. I&#8217;d just stripped the bed, wiped down the mattress cover and put a new sheet on when the doorbell rang. I quickly threw open the window, sprayed air freshener around and bundled the wet sheet and towel into the laundry basket. Deliberately wetting the bed on Saturday or Sunday mornings has to be the most erotic though. The evening before I try to be careful about what I drink &#8216; neither too much nor too little so that hopefully I wake up bursting. What I then do is tease myself, telling myself that I really ought to go to the loo before I wet the bed and all the time squeezing my thighs together and gently touching myself, my satin knickers getting gradually wetter with my juices and little spurts of wee as I try to prolong the pleasure till my bladder just gives in. As I reach that point I squeeze myself, setting of my orgasm and a hot flood in my pants as it pours over my clit, thighs, and bottom, pooling around me and soaking my silky nightie and the sheet. On a good day I can come several times as I lay there in the warm wetness, only getting up when it becomes cold uncomfortable. What a wonderful way to start the day &#8216; a release from stress and very relaxing! So that&#8217;s my story. A simple accident when I couldn&#8217;t quite make it to the loo in time and an amazing orgasmic discovery at the same time. I love it!<br />
