                <p>From an early age I discovered that I obtained much sexual pleasure from holding my pee until I was really desperate. I&#8217;ve often played little games with myself whilst out and about just seeing how long I can hold out without going to the toilet. Last weekend I woke up needing a wee but decided to hold on. I was planning a shopping trip and the thought of walking around town whilst desperate to wee was already turning me on. I drank plenty of orange juice with my breakfast and could already feel the pressure on my bladder building up. I put on my short denim skirt and a pair of black panties and set off for town.<br />
The town was very busy and there were lots of queues. At one point whilst waiting at the bank I could feel the pressure building, I was beginning to jiggle around and hoped nobody would notice. After I left the bank I passed the toilets but decided to hang on a little longer. I was enjoying the warm sensations too much to let it go now. I went into a clothes shop and picked out some clothes to try on. Inside the changing cubicle I took off my skirt and admired my body in the mirror. I inspected my black panties and saw they were quite wet from excitement, I couldn&#8217;t help sliding a finger inside my panties and feeling my swollen wetness, swollen with excitement and the pressure of built up pee.<br />
As I gently rubbed myself whilst looking in the mirror I felt a spasm and I leaked a little wee onto my hand and the carpet. I almost let go there and then but quickly brought myself under control. I put my skirt back on over my now very wet panties and left the cubicle hoping nobody would notice the little wet spot on the carpet.<br />
I put the clothes back on the rack and made my way quickly out of the store, keeping my legs together as much as I could. I could feel the wetness squelching between my legs and it was making me very horny. Another spasm hit me and it was all I could do not to wet myself in the middle of the mall. I knew that I would never make the toilets, besides I fancied a little fun so I made my way to a nearby elevator and pressed the button. The elevator took ages to arrive and by this time I was clenching and unclenching my muscles and almost bending double. At last, the elevator arrived and now shaking with excitement I entered and pressed the button for the top floor. I felt the elevator start to move and at the same time I started to leak. I quickly pulled up my skirt but just as I was beginning to squat on the lift floor it stopped and I knew the doors were about to open again. I jammed my hand between my legs from behind and managed to stop my flow. I&#8217;d already made a small puddle on the floor but managed to regain my composure and stood in front my puddle as the doors opened. A young couple came in and asked if I was going up. &#8220;Yes&#8221; I gasped. They gave me a strange look and turned to face the doors. I hoped they couldn&#8217;t smell my wee, I certainly could and I could feel it trickling down my legs into my shoes. I still had my hand wedged between my legs from behind. I looked down and my puddle was growing, I prayed that they wouldn&#8217;t look round. Luckily they didn&#8217;t but when I got to the top floor there was a guy waiting to get in!<br />
I had no choice but to leave the elevator, had I stayed I would have wet myself in front of the guy on the way down. I hobbled out of the lift leaving a trail of drips and ran through the door into the stairwell. As the door shut behind me I leant behind it, opened my legs and just peed through my knickers all over the landing. I brought myself off with my fingers as my whole night&#8217;s worth of saved pee just ran out of me, forming a stream and trickling down the stairs. It felt so sexy.<br />
