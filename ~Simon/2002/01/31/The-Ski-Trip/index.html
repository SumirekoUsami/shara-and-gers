                <p>Yesterday we had a night ski trip to a small ski resort with just one slope. We had a little race scheduled for 7, and due to heavy traffic, we didn&#8217;t get there until 10 minutes prior to start. There were about 20 people in our group. There was heavy drinking going on during the bus ride, and right when we finally got there, several of the guys went straight out and peed in the snow. When I got out of the bus, I could see three girls starting to walk down to the little town to search for a bathroom, as I had hoped. But our leader shouted after them to come back, as we had to hurry to get to the start of the race. So we all got our skies and got to the lift quickly, and the race started. Everybody was to go down three times. After the second time, when I was waiting in the line for the lift, I stood right behind the three girls. I got on together with Katrin. When we were on the lift, she started to bounce her legs up and down slightly, and I asked if she was cold. She replied: &#8220;No, I just have to pee really bad.&#8221; She told me that she had to pee when we got here, but there had not been a chance since. When we got up, we went down for the third time, and I was right behind the three girls. When we were down, the three girls immediately got their skis off and headed towards the open–air bar. I decided to follow them. When I got to the bar, I saw the three of them stand in a line for the single toilet that was there. There were three other people before them. Katrin was fifth in line; Julia was in front of her and Bettina standing after her. All three of them were showing clear signs of growing desperation. Julia was pacing back and forth, bending her knees. Bettina was crossing and uncrossing her legs. But Katrin was clearly bursting; she was running on the spot, bending over, and from now and then squeezed her crotch with one hand briefly. After five minutes, there was only one person left in front of the girls. When this one got into the loo, Julia began to pace around even more and couldn&#8217;t stand still. After about 30 seconds she banged on the door and said: &#8220;Please hurry up in there, it&#8217;s an emergency!&#8221; Katrin was frantic by now, she had her tights clamped together and wiggled around. She had the most desperate expression on her face. Bettina was also in big trouble. She stood there, bent over slightly, and suddenly said: &#8220;I&#8217;ve just gotta pee!&#8221; With that she ran off towards some trees, but about halfway she suddenly stood and began jerking around here pants. She jumped around while trying to get all her clothes off, and finally squatted and let go. This sight was almost too much for Julia. She banged on the door again and shouted: &#8220;Please let me in, I&#8217;m gonna wet my pants!&#8221; Finally the door opened, and Julia dashed in, leaving a bursting Katrin waiting. She made no signs of peeing outdoors, and kept doing her pee–dance. She clamped her legs together, then bent over, pressed her hand at her crotch, and then bounced up and down. Suddenly she froze, almost doubled over and both her hands pressed against her crotch she shouted for Julia to hurry up. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be out in a minute&#8221;, said Julia from inside the loo. Katrin had clearly let go some into her panties by now and began unzipping her pants while still running on the spot. Just when I thought she&#8217;d make it, two guys passed the loo and began peeing just a few meters away. That was too much for Katrin. She moaned aloud, and her pants came down and I could see piss gushing from her crotch. Just then Julia came out of the loo, Katrin hobbled in past her. Afterwards she quickly went to the bus and didn&#8217;t get out again &#8216;till we went home.<br />
