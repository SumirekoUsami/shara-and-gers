                <p>Earlier today I had my first wetting experience (Playing Sick), and I can&#8217;t stop thinking about it! I remember the warmth forming between my legs. I remember orgasming like I never have before as the pee flooded my panties. It was the most orgasmic experience of my life, but I needed to make it better. Last time I peed on the toilet. This time I would need to do something more exotic!<br />
I lay back on my bed, again trying to study for my test. After all, I do have a test today. I tried to think of equations, but all I could think of was the sight of that wonderful dark patch growing in my panties earlier today. My panties were white and the pee was wet; it felt so good. It even flooded my bottom as I sat on the toilet, peeing my panties. But enough about that, I need to study for this test.<br />
Okay, I give up. I will study after I masturbate one more time. Certainly after that I will be able to concentrate and pass this test. This time I need to cum like I have never cum before. I need to pee my panties again. I only have one problem; I don&#8217;t need to pee.<br />
As I drink all the water I can, I stop to think. Today is the day I can do all the things I have ever wanted to do. With this, and the desire to pee in mind, I think of my parents&#8217; liquor cabinet. I have never drunk alcohol before, but have heard it makes you pee. It seems perfect. I have wanted to drink the alcohol in the cabinet for a while, and now I wanted to pee. It was all too perfect.<br />
I don&#8217;t know anything about alcoholic drinks, but I have heard about rum and coke. Rum was in the cabinet, and coke was in the refrigerator.<br />
After three rum and cokes, I felt good. I could cum right now, but I didn&#8217;t want to. I wanted to feel the pee again. Last time I peed my panties sitting on the toilet. This time I wanted to pee myself somewhere else, but where?<br />
I had the best idea yet! I would lay in my bed with the covers over me, and pee. I know I tried this before, but this time I was drunk!! I pulled the covers over me and lay on my back. The need to pee was growing, and I felt the need to rub myself to stop from peeing.<br />
When I rubbed myself, I almost cummed, but I didn&#8217;t. I still only had my panties and halfâ€“shirt on. I felt this would be unfulfilling as I wanted to feel more warmth. I needed something to soak up the golden warmth. My tight gymnastics pants may work. I pictured the pee spreading in the gymnastics pants, but felt they would let all the heat out. I then sighted my best tightest jeans. These would be the best. I pulled them on. I rubbed myself a little more, as I drank one more rum and coke. There was no way around it, I was drunk, I needed to pee, and I was horny. Here I was, under all of my blankets, in my tightest jeans, drunk, horny, and desperate.<br />
I rub myself and play with my tits. I can come at any time, but I need to pee to feel the best. I lay back and relax. I concentrate all my thoughts on the warmth, but still hesitate. I rub myself again and begin to feel myself peeing. The need is overwhelming, but something keeps me from letting go. I rub my thighs and nipples, and start to imagine pee flowing in my pants.<br />
Here it comes; the warmth is here. I am drunk, but I still feel the pee. I lay back on the bed and pee forms on my panties. It is so warm, and it&#8217;s growing. It has flooded by panties and my jeans. Look at my jeans, what a patch. I see it growing, and it feels great. This is the best algebra test ever!!!<br />
