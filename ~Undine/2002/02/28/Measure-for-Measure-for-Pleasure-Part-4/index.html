                <p>Measure for Measure for Pleasure ( Part 4 )<br />
Jane and her mum were staying with Katie and her mum for a short holiday. Jane had arrived suffering from a bladder complaint that left her with a control problem and inclined to accidents. Her embarrassing state was made worse if any sexual stimulation were indulged inâ€“ for it most certainly delayed the healing process. Unfortunately, the medication that Jane was on had a side effect; it caused vaginal irritation that nearly drove Jane to nymphomania. To make matters worse, the doctor had Jane fitted with a panty girdle that acted like a chastity belt to prevent her from scratching or indulging in masturbation. It fastened in such a way that she could not remove without help and supervision. These conditions had caused her some humiliation during her stay; yet she had managed to find satisfaction in a number of ways. One satisfying episode had occurred at night in Katie&#8217;s double bed. Katie&#8217;s tongue had been the instrument of her release. The last thing that Katie had done was to secure Jane&#8217;s incontinence girdle before the girls went to sleep. The morning found the two sleeping girls lying back to back. As the light strengthened and Katie on the left slumbered on dreamlessly, Jane was restless, and dreamed sketchily of the man who the night before had brought love into her life with the promise of a deep and fulfilling relationship. He was dominant and strong, able to satisfy her deepest cravings. She, being subservient, dreamed that she is with him walking home in the heat of the summer&#8217;s afternoon. They have been drinking at the local village pub and she tells him playfully that she needs to wee. She senses that this excites him, so she plays on it by holding herself, and pretending she is going to wet herself. She stops and stands still lifting up her skirt so he can see that the back of her panties is wet. He fondles her through her panties, till she is groaning to fulfill two needs instead of just the one. Then he leads her in to a woodland glade. She knows what he wants. She squats before him, lowering her panties so that he can see her cunt lips. Then, as she is watching his prick which he has taken out, he encouragers her to pee, and like an Indian rope trick she watches his cock grow hard and ready to slide up and down on. He leans forward to kiss her as she starts to pee. Ahhh, this is almost like coming before being touched, but suddenly his face begins to fade and recede. He is now shouting her name repeatedly, wait&#8230; it is no longer his voice but Katie&#8217;s. Her face is tight with anger. &#8220;Jane, you are pissing the bed!&#8221; Suddenly the sunny glade is gone; the ceiling of Katie&#8217;s bedroom greets her opening eyes. Katie is shaking her awake. &#8220;You&#8217;re wetting the bloody bed! Stop, stop! Wake up now.&#8221; Her mind starts to comprehend. She is peeing and the bed is wet, her incontinence panties have let her down. Her hand flies to feel her bottom. The pee is squirting out onto the sheets, oh no!!! Her special panties have not been secured properly. She has ruined Katie&#8217;s expensive new bed, how terribly humiliating. She screams as Katie slaps her face, exhorting her to stop peeing and get out of the bed. The next thing both mums are in the bedroom lifting Jane from the bed still peeing and then dumping her in the shower, where she sits trying to pull her wits together. In the bed room the air is filled with shouts of derision and scorn from Katie&#8217;s mum and embarrassed defense from Jane&#8217;s mum.<br />
Later, much, much later, Katie and Jane had to admit they had not handled it well. Romaly (Katie&#8217;s mum) wanted to know who was going to pay for a new bed while Heather (Jane&#8217;s mum) could not understand how it had happened.<br />
Heather would like to have been able to say she would buy a new bed straight away. But money was tight in her household, and she would have to tell her husband why she had spent five hundred pounds. Then she would have to tell him that their beloved daughter had ruined the bed of her sister, as well as how she had come by her weakened bladder. She was starting to feel ill at the thought, though she certainly could understand why Romaly was angry, even though she and her husband were wealthy. Worse things could have happened. For the rest of the morning there was a terrible atmosphere in the house. Finally, Jane, in a paroxysm of tears, cornered Romaly and apologized with promises that she would sell her watch, bike, jewelry, in fact all that she possessed just to be forgiven. This melted Romaly&#8217;s heart and all seemed forgiven. Mind you, Romaly still did insist that a rubber sheet be used on the replacement bed. She also insisted that Heather personally saw to it that as long as they stayed she would inspect Jane&#8217;s incontinence panties to see that they were properly fastened. This involved Heather accompanying Jane on her last visit to the toilet and supervising her. This humiliating touch was tolerated, and the household returned to normal. Three days later Heather got a phone call from home that required her to return home for a few days. After she had departed Katie took over from Jane&#8217;s mum in assisting Jane who was by now fully recovered.<br />
