                <p>I wanted to write about my experience today.<br />
Firstly, I am a 23 year old lady, normal I suppose in most ways – except that I like the look of my body and I am a little kinky. I have always liked to be a showoff. I sometimes like to do things like show my panties in public or funny things like that. And ever since I was young, I have enjoyed wetting myself.<br />
I haven&#8217;t done this for a while, but over the past couple of days I have seen some wetting sites on the internet, and it excited me. So today, I decided I would pee in public for the first time.<br />
I started off early, by drinking enough water at home that I nearly felt sick, and left straight for the train to the city. Once on there, I already needed to go – but I wanted to see if I could hold it!<br />
Well, as you could guess on a 50 minute train ride, bumpy and shaky as it is, I was in quite a bit of discomfort – but excited all the same. I am glad to say I made it to the station, but as I was getting up to go to the doors for my station, it started. Just a little spirt – but enough to soak my crotch. I am sure no one saw that though, as I wore a nice short skirt so it wouldn&#8217;t get wet and give me away if I did anything!<br />
I couldn&#8217;t beleive myself already – here I was, busting to pee, and if I was at home I would have let it go, but I was in public. And I had just walked past the toilet, though I was already wet! I was shaking from nervousness.<br />
My next &#8216;stop&#8217; was the escalator – and a rather long one at that. I seemed to be ok when I was walking, but as soon as I had to stop, I couldn&#8217;t hold it any longer – but I didn&#8217;t want to cross my legs or anything – so I just let it go for about 5 seconds. If anyone noticed, they didn&#8217;t say anything, but it made me so horny that if I had put my hands between my legs, I am sure I would have come!<br />
I was so excited – my first &#8216;public&#8217; peeing experience, and I got away with it! From there though, I went straight to the ladies and finished off – without taking off my panties.<br />
I tried to go about my business for a little longer that day, but I just couldn&#8217;t focus. I could feel the damp panties in my crotch, and if I spread my legs a litte under my desk I could see the big damp patch in the middle of my panties – so I left work and went for a walk.<br />
I was already &#8216;wanting&#8217; to go, but certianaly not like this morning – so I went first to the Irish pub and got myself a guiness, and then another. It went straight to me head because I hadn&#8217;t eaten, but it gave me a new boldness.<br />
I went straight from there to the Myer centre, and headed for the escalators – I was so excited about the morning I wanted to do it again. As soon as I got on I tried to pee again – but I couldn&#8217;t – there was a guy a the side of the escalator looking up my skirt! It made me hornier again.<br />
Being too nervous to let anything out, I went to the botanical gardens. When I got there, there were people everywhere (lunchtime), and I decided this was my time. I went to a kind of crowded spot on one of the grassy hills, and lay down, spreading my legs a litte – with my skirt I know I had a coupld of guys moving so they could watch me. And so I relaxed (with the help of good Irish beer), and let it all go – every last drop&#8230;.<br />
And that was my day today. As I sit here, still in my recently wet panties again (but at home), I thought you might like to know I had the best orgasm in my life – all from my first public pee.<br />
No doubt, I will be out and about again someday, when I get up the guts.<br />
