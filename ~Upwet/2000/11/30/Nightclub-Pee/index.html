                <p>Wow! I had such a great time with my last public wetting, I just had to do it again sometime – but I just couldn&#8217;t find the time to plan something as elaborate as my first public pee – so I was suprised when the next one happened by accident&#8230;<br />
I had a long day at work, and did some overtime until about 9PM – to survive I had drank no small amount of Coffee&#8230; Having had enough I decided to go out for a drink after work to relax.<br />
I walked down to the local nightclub, and whilst walking, decided that maybe I should have went to the loo before I left. Not being too fond of public toilets anytime, let alone at night, I decided to hold until I got there&#8230;<br />
When I did get inside, there were only two toilets – one closed, and the other with some girl who had drank way too much asn was being sick – I just couldn&#8217;t take it so I went out to dance for a while&#8230;<br />
A fewdrinks later (maybe 5?), I was feeling much more relaxed, and was certainly developing an urgency to go – I went back, but there were now about 8 people waiting in line – most holding themselves! So I went back to dance for a while, meaning to come back soon&#8230;<br />
And that was when it happened. I was dancing with a group of girls, when one decided to trip over and bump me – sending me sprawling across the dance floor, flashing my panties at everyone who I slid past. Maybe the Scotch helped, but I also hadn&#8217;t realised how desperate I was until my pee was pulsating out through my panties on to the dance floor!<br />
Embarrased as anything, I ran outside, and looked for the quietest place I could find – which was no where! I was already leaking again, and could feel my stockings and shoes getting wet – so I went to a nearby bench (no one else was there thank god), and let it go. I think that was one of the longest pee&#8217;s in my life!<br />
But maybe all that drink had affected me – I was now rather turned on, and decided to go back in and dance for a little longer – wet panties and all! I must say that from that unplanned accident, I had one of the horniest times of my life! It goes to show you don&#8217;t have to plan to pee in public to have a good time&#8230;<br />
Love<br />
