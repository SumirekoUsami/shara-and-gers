            <div class="mt-4">
                <p>I&#8217;m in the midst of holding it, all alone, and I&#8217;m already quite far into the game. I&#8217;m dressed entirely in black, my tightest jeans and a small black tee. I would prefer to be wearing more clothes, because when the time comes, there&#8217;s just nothing quite as delicious as the feeling of all the hot wetness soaking me, through the fabric, first coming warm and quickly turning cold. But I&#8217;m not there yet. I&#8217;ve been gulping water and soda constantly for the past three hours. It&#8217;s getting bad. My bladder is thrashing around like a dying fish– a big, heavy one.<br />
It&#8217;s going to start hurting in earnest any minute now. I know my body quite well, having done this same thing countless times. Already I can feel my urethra quivering, trying to tell me to let it relax. I&#8217;m already so full and nervous I&#8217;ve muted the TV and made the place quiet, as once I get to this stage even the merest distraction puts me in danger of spurting. I don&#8217;t like to allow myself even the tiniest trickle until I am ready, if I can help it. One or two always manage to escape, despite my contortions. Right now my legs are squeezed together very tightly.<br />
My bladder is burning, bitching at me for relief. I&#8217;m going to tell it to be quiet. It won&#8217;t be quiet, God bless it. It will continue to worry itself for a long time, I know. I can barely type, my hand keeps trying to clench itself between my knees. I never actually hold my crotch, that doesn&#8217;t seem to help me for some reason, it never has. But my pulse is high and I feel a cold sweat. I keep realizing I&#8217;m holding my breath without meaning to. My fantasies are coming more and more quickly too, there&#8217;s one I came up with last night about a can–can dancer in Paris in the 1930&#8217;s. Her name is Anthea, and her chorus master is very strict about schedules. One night she has to go onstage in front of a crowd of Parisian dignitaries, hundreds, all the cream of the Paris social elite. It could be her chance to be discovered, but she has a problem. Due to the prestige of the event, the chorus master has kept his girls rehearsing all day, a real whip–cracker he is, with his girls, and will not tolerate weakness, and there was no time for a break from final rehearsal until the performance.<br />
I can&#8217;t concentrate on the details because my bladder is filling relentlessly. I&#8217;m mmm&#8230; squirming quite frequently now. I looked at my face in the mirror, (I happen to be in love with myself), and my beautiful face is pinched with worry no matter how calm a mask I try to&#8230;. oooh. Almost leaked. I think if I just grind my jeans–clad perineum against the chair, the pressure may relent a little. It&#8217;s not helping. My bladder feels like it&#8217;s humming the Flight of the Bumblebee. I have to pee really badly.<br />
Okay, now it&#8217;s starting to hurt. And it&#8217;s hard to tell, now, if I&#8217;ve actually let a drop escape, or if I&#8217;m just wet from how exciting this is for me. Ohhh, my head is in a completely different place now. As my twin sister (identical) Bridget often says, when you get to this point, where your head disappears in the frantic white noise of desperation, it&#8217;s like stepping onto another planet. I just caught myself making a whimpering sound. Now I have to squirm again. I&#8217;m going to get up and look in the mirror now to see if my abdomen is swollen and to refill my water glass.<br />
Ohh, it hurts to walk. And I can&#8217;t walk slowly when I really have to pee, like I do now. Trust me, I really do. The thought of releasing my urine is so tempting, it would be such bliss, to cool the fire of sheer panic down there. I&#8217;m so glad I&#8217;m alone, to feel such agony in the presence of others, I&#8217;d be in tears of utter hum..hum&#8230;humiliation. Oh, god, I can barely type. I really have to pee. <span class="caps">BAD</span>. I&#8217;ll try to calm down, but my bladder is hard as a rock, screaming, my urethra snapping, and the dense throbbing almost unbearable. No position is comfortable. And my abdomen IS swollen. My poor, trembling bladder is hard as a rock. Now it hurts. It hurts pretty badly. Ohhh, please, please please let me pee! No, I won&#8217;t. But I&#8217;m about to pee in my pants. I want to pee so badly. I need to. But no, I have to hold it. So, in the can–can fantasy, the girl ends up spraying her long–held Parisian wee all over the stage through her panties and garters, as she&#8217;s dancing&#8230;<br />
Oh, I&#8217;m about to pee. I don&#8217;t think I can hold it anymore. The pain is almost unbearable. Oh! I leaked– I really, really couldn&#8217;t help it. I tried. Only a tiny drop, but I&#8217;m so close to breaking completely&#8230; OH! Another one&#8230; it&#8217;s coming&#8230;. I&#8217;m struggling with all my strength to hold it&#8230; my teeth chattering&#8230; clenching&#8230;. I can&#8217;t concentrate&#8230; it hurts <span class="caps">SOOOO</span> bad&#8230; I want to GO, NOw&#8230; ohhhhh&#8230;. god&#8230;, deep breaths. The cramps of panic are <span class="caps">TERRIBLE</span>. I&#8217;m sorry&#8230; I can&#8217;t do anything now except hold it&#8230; Im absolutely bursting with need. REally, my bladder feels like it&#8217;s going to split. I can&#8217;t hold it&#8230; yes i can.. no no no&#8230;.ahhh!<br />
Really&#8230;I&#8217;m going to pee in my pants, right here&#8230; Icantwaitanothersecond&#8230; it&#8217;s going to come&#8230;it hurts so much, the throbbing, the pinching, the burning, the fullness, I&#8217;m consumed by it&#8230;ohhhh&#8230;.damn, it&#8217;s bad. Real bad. It&#8217;s just awful, the pressure is hellishly gorgeous.<br />
I can&#8217;t type anymore. Im going to explode&#8230;. i can&#8217;t i can&#8217;t &#8230; really. <br />
