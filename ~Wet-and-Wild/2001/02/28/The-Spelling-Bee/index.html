                <p>This story is based on a true event. The names were changed to protect the embarrassed. <br />
Nicole was the best speller in my class. One day, we had a spelling bee and the winner went on to the school competition. Being a horrible speller, I was the first out. I was sitting down and could see Nicole fidgeting. She&#8217;s about 5&#8217; 6&#8221; and has long legs and long blonde hair. I could tell she was desperate because it was 5th period and she didn&#8217;t go all day. After a few more rounds, she was shifting from side to side. She asked if she could go to the bathroom but the teacher said she couldn&#8217;t go until after the spelling bee. Nicole whined and stayed quiet except for the noise when she switched feet. The spelling bee went on for a while. We have 5th and 6th period together so it was really long. Nicole again asked to leave but the teacher said not until she misspelled a word and had to sit down. Knowing that she wouldn&#8217;t lose intentionally and that Bobby was as good as she was, it would be awhile longer. After about 20 more minutes, she let out a loud whine and burst for the door. A large puddle had appeared and no one had even noticed! She came back after about 10 minutes with a very large wet spot on her really tight faded blue jeans. I left the classroom to sneak into the girlsâ€™ bathroom. She had left her white pee soaked (now yellow!) panties in there. I picked them up and put them in my locker. After a couple months, we started going out. I told her how I liked seeing her really desperate. She said that she liked it too. I gave her back her panties that I had kept. We went out for another 8 months. She moved in January but before she left she gave me three pairs of her panties that she had thoroughly soaked! I still have them now and it is 5 years later. I moved to the same city that she had moved to and we continued our hot and steamy wet relationship! <br />
